Happy New Year.

As we step into 2026, it is customary to set new resolutions. However, my mindset this year is different. Instead of chasing grand, lofty goals, my focus has shifted to two fundamental concepts: **Stability** and **Consistency**.

### Work & Life: The Art of Holding Steady

Professionally, the urge to "skyrocket" to success overnight has faded. I am no longer looking for a meteoric rise. In these volatile times, simply maintaining a steady course and avoiding major pitfalls is a victory in itself. "Steady wins the race" is my new mantra.

On the relationship front, everything is peaceful. I am content with the status quo, and that peace of mind is a blessing that needs no further elaboration.

### The Wake-Up Call: Health Metrics

While my mind is at peace, my body has issued a silent protest.

My recent medical checkup was a wake-up call. The report was filled with "red flags," to the point where long-term medication has become a reality. My BMI is hovering dangerously close to the upper limit.

I need to exercise—not just sporadically, but sustainably.

I used to use the elliptical machine while taking my kids to the pool, but my knees couldn't handle the impact. I stopped for a while due to the pain. Recently, I've pivoted to doing push-ups at home or swimming (which is much kinder to my knees).

My goal for 2026 is simple: Find a rhythm that works for me, keep my spirits high, and turn exercise into a habit, not a chore.

### The Blog: A Strategic Pivot

Beyond health, the center of my life outside of work is this blog.

Here is a confession: I originally wanted to build a long-form indie game. However, I realized a flaw in my plan—**the feedback loop for game development is too long.**

From zero to a playable alpha, it can take weeks, months, or even years. Without regular output and feedback, it is incredibly hard to maintain momentum.

That is why I decided to pivot. I chose blogging as a way to force myself to produce content daily. Writing offers a shorter cycle and immediate completion. It allows me to practice "shipping" something every day.

This doesn't mean I've abandoned the game. I am simply using the blog to build the discipline, logic, and material needed to eventually tackle that long-term project.

### Finding My Pace

Whether it's swimming laps in the pool or typing lines of code and text, my hope for this year is to find my own pace.

It's not about being the fastest; it's about lasting the longest.

Here's to a year of steady progress.
