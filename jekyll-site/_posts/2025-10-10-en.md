I have to start with a confession: This might be the most "unnecessary" unboxing review you’ll ever read on my blog.

Last month, I bought the latest Pixel 10 Pro Fold. With a price tag of $1919 USD, it costs as much as a high-end laptop. For someone like me—an "old-school" minimalist who believes in using things until they fall apart, and whose clothes can last decades—this was undoubtedly the most extravagant impulse (or perhaps, pushed) purchase of my life.

Normally, my material desires are extremely low. My wife and I share most expenses for food, housing, and transport. She handles the part of life that involves "enjoying the finer things," so I rarely need to splurge on expensive personal items. This time, however, the purchase was largely thanks to my dear wife.

# The Nudge: Buy the Foldable or Be Left Behind?

My previous phone, a Pixel 6, was bought over four years ago for less than $600. It was still perfectly functional, save for an annoying black line that sometimes appeared on the camera. I had zero motivation to upgrade.

That’s when my wife started her campaign: "You're a tech person! You can't refuse new gadgets! If you don't try a foldable, you'll be left behind by the times!"

The fear of "being left behind" was a powerful motivator. Combined with access to a decent employee discount, I finally gave in—a dual surrender to "not missing out on new tech" and "not disappointing my wife."

# Initial Thoughts: My Personal Verdict on the Foldable

After several days of deep use, I have to be honest: for my specific use case, the practical utility of the foldable phone is remarkably low.

My phone usage is extremely basic:

* Answering calls and texts.
* Listening to Podcasts during my commute.
* Playing casual games to pass the time while waiting in line.
* At home or in the office, my laptop is my primary device.

The core advantage of the foldable is the large screen, but even unfolded, it’s not bigger than my laptop. And the unique, "Fold-exclusive" features offer almost zero value to my life:

* Rear-Camera Selfies: This old man has no desire to take high-res selfies. The premium camera advantage is wasted.
* Live Translate: I travel abroad to places where English is not spoken less than once a year on average, and even then, I can usually manage. This AI translation feature will likely go unused for the entire year.
* Large Screen Multitasking: My work requires efficient keyboard input and multi-window management—the phone's multitasking efficiency simply cannot replace a laptop.

The bottom line? I spent a huge amount of money for a device that is "bigger-screened, but largely meaningless" to my personal workflow.

# Low ROI, High Social Value

If I were to judge this purchase purely on my personal Cost-Performance Ratio (CP value), it would rank very low. But looking on the bright side, the purchase wasn't entirely without merit:

First, I successfully avoided being "left behind by the times" (thanks, wife).

Second, foldables are still relatively uncommon. When I open the phone in a meeting or a café, it inevitably becomes a great conversation starter. It has actually created several opportunities for casual interaction.

Apologies for this slightly padded review, but since I've spent all my recent free time adapting to this new phone, I simply ran out of energy to write about other topics. Please bear with me! Consider this my expensive tuition fee for breaking out of my self-imposed "minimalist echo chamber."
