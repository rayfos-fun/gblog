title: "From \"Hustle Culture\" to \"Sustainable Pace\": My Efficiency Awakening in Tech"

Years ago, during my early career in the Taiwanese tech industry, the prevailing culture was intense. The unspoken rule was that "hard work" was a universal virtue. Time was meant to be poured into the job; weekends and holidays felt like luxuries. We wore our long hours like a badge of honor, sacrificing personal time to achieve performance, believing it was the only path to success. We were, essentially, glorifying burnout.

Later, carrying this "stake-your-life-on-it" attitude—a product of my Asian cultural training—I was fortunate enough to join the American tech scene as a newcomer.

### The Culture Shock of the First High-Priority Task

When I received my first high-priority task, my instinct was to tackle it head-on, no matter the cost. Channeling all the grit I had learned in Taiwan, I pulled an all-nighter and aggressively squashed the bug. As I submitted the fix, I braced for praise, expecting my sheer "effort" to be celebrated.

However, the response I received was surprisingly muted. The task being completed was good, but no one offered excessive commendation or encouragement for my late hours.

### The Value of "Effort" in the US Tech Scene

Through the process of adapting, I gradually came to understand and internalize the American tech culture. There is no excessive expectation for you to "overwork," or at least, not the kind of effort that sacrifices your personal life.

To be clear, if you choose to burn yourself out to illuminate the company, your manager certainly won't object. But here's the crucial difference: if you need to leave promptly at 3 PM to pick up your kids, or adjust your schedule for personal commitments, management generally won't interfere excessively. The control you have over your own time felt significantly greater than it did back in Asia.

This isn't an absolute rule—there are always exceptions based on individual companies or teams—but on average, I believe this observation holds: **Asian work culture often emphasizes time commitment and the visible display of "hustle," while American culture tends to prioritize "output" and "efficiency."**

### A Deep Reflection on the Definition of Hard Work

This entire experience forced me to rethink the very definition of "hard work."

> If you consistently need to pull all-nighters or spend a massive amount of extra time just to meet goals (or exceed them for a promotion), doesn't that suggest your core "efficiency" is lagging?

If an individual is already operating at near-saturation, close to the edge of collapse, sustained only by working overtime, what happens when they get promoted and are handed even greater responsibilities? Is it not a fast track to complete burnout?

Looking back, my decision to stay up all night fixing that high-priority bug now seems... charmingly misguided. It was not just a display of inefficiency; it was a non-sustainable consumption of my personal resource.

Perhaps true success isn't about who can burn the longest, but who can burn the brightest, most efficiently, and most sustainably.
