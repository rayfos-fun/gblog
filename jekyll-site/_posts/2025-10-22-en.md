In tech interviews, the spotlight often shines on $LeetCode$ difficulty, algorithmic optimization, and code elegance. However, as an interviewer, the single factor that best differentiates a senior engineer from a junior one is their response to ambiguous requirements. Today, I want to share my favorite interview question: "Given a graph, a starting point, and an ending point, find the shortest path." Why does a textbook problem become my multi-tool for measuring communication, critical thinking, and engineering capability?

# The Deliberately Vague Opening: Testing an Engineer's "First Instinct"

This question is intentionally designed to be concise and vague, serving to simulate a real-world request from a Product Manager (PM) or client. They often present a rough goal, not a complete technical specification.

When a candidate hears "graph" and "shortest path," I observe their immediate reaction:

1. Jumping to Implementation (The Intuitive Type): They immediately think of BFS or Dijkstra's algorithm, perhaps even starting to draw a 2D matrix (like a maze or map) on the whiteboard.
2. Pausing to Ask Questions (The Deliberate Type): They first pose a series of clarifying questions to understand the nature of the "graph" and the definition of the "shortest path."

For recent graduates or junior engineers, I won't penalize a direct jump to $BFS$—they are still building their coding muscle memory. However, for experienced engineers aiming for a senior role, rushing to a solution before the requirements are clear is a fundamental mistake in software engineering. I deduct points, not because their technical skill is lacking, but because they neglected the core engineering duty: transforming vague requests into precise specifications.

# The Essential Questions Great Communicators Ask

In a real engineering environment, a good team member must be a proactive communicator. They understand that 15 minutes spent clarifying requirements can save 15 hours of incorrect implementation. Below are the key questions I expect candidates to ask:

| Question Category | Details to Clarify (Refining the Requirements) |
| :--- | :--- |
| The Nature of the Graph | 1. What is the scale of the graph? (Order of magnitude for nodes V and edges E) 2. Is the graph sparse or dense? 3. Is the graph directed or undirected? |
| Data Structure | 4. What is the underlying data structure? Is it an Adjacency Matrix or an Adjacency List? |
| Path Definition| 5. Are the edge weights (distances) fixed or variable? Are there any negative weights? 6. Are we looking for the shortest path itself (the sequence of nodes) or simply the shortest distance value? |

The back-and-forth on these questions not only reveals the candidate's grasp of data structures but also tells me whether they have the habit of systematizing and engineering a problem.

# The Technical Assessment: Clarity Over Optimal Solution

Once the requirements are clear, the interview moves to the technical phase. The strength of this question is its ability to cover multiple technical domains while allowing for flexible difficulty control:

1. Algorithmic Thinking: The optimal solution is Dijkstra's algorithm, which requires familiarity with the application of complex data structures like the Priority Queue (or Heap).
2. Coding Proficiency: I don't strictly require Dijkstra's. If the candidate can write a clean, elegant brute-force search (using recursion, a queue (BFS), or a stack (DFS)) to find the shortest among all possible paths, and do it well, they still receive high praise.
3. Time Complexity Analysis: Regardless of the method implemented, the ability to reasonably analyze the time and space complexity of their code (e.g., O(V!) for brute force; O(E log V) for Dijkstra$'s is a non-negotiable skill for a senior engineer.

# Conclusion: Tech is the Foundation, Communication is the Ceiling

In the rapidly evolving field of software engineering, technical details constantly change, but effective communication and clear thinking are timeless.

A truly excellent engineer is not just someone who writes the fastest-running code, but a "problem solver" who can extract precise specifications from vague goals and guide the team in the right direction.

So, the next time you encounter a simple yet ambiguous question in an interview, remember this: Put down your keyboard, and pick up your questions. Every question you ask adds value to your profile as an engineer.
