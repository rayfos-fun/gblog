From the end of the 2022 pandemic boom to the ensuing mass layoffs across the tech industry, and finally, the rise of AI ushering in the "Software Engineer Apocalypse," the last few years have been a period of intense anxiety and dread for many of us in the industry.

I was one of those who felt the deepest psychological toll.

# Infected by Fear: From Palpitations to the Edge of Depression

In 2022, as major tech companies started laying off staff (often 5% or more) after their pandemic-era over-hiring, collective anxiety was pervasive.

My own mental resilience was poor. I spent my days immersed in the toxicity of platforms like Blind (the anonymous social app), constantly surrounded by rumors and negative energy. That collective fear spread like a virus, pushing me to the brink of depression. I frequently experienced heart palpitations, lost all motivation for work, and felt that no matter how hard I tried, my efforts would ultimately be met with betrayal.

Adding fuel to the fire, the narrative that "AI will replace software engineers" began to gain traction. I lived in constant dread, and this low mood persisted for years. I even tried to book an appointment with a therapist, but the attempt failed due to language barriers—I worried that being unable to find a Chinese-speaking professional would add more stress, so I gave up.

# Climbing Out of the Valley: Time and the Focus Factor

Fortunately, I am now starting to feel like myself again. Summing up this difficult period, I attribute a large part of my recovery to Time.

The human spirit has a powerful capacity for self-healing. After being in a low state for a long period, when you consciously realize, "I cannot continue like this," your mind and body slowly activate a self-adjustment mechanism to restore normality.

During that time, I consumed countless self-help articles and videos, desperately trying to pull myself out. Among all the "chicken soup," one piece of advice proved the most practically helpful:

    "Don't let things you cannot control (like macro layoffs or the development of AI) dictate your emotions; focus instead on what you can control."

This simple reframing helped redirect my attention away from existential dread and back to my code, my learning, and my life.

# Avoiding Toxicity: The Shameful but Effective "Ostrich Strategy"

Another method that offered immense relief, though it feels a bit like the Ostrich Strategy (burying my head in the sand), was to cut off negative news sources.

I decisively deleted the Blind app. I deliberately avoided clicking on sensational headlines about layoffs or the "AI crisis." Extracting myself from that environment, which constantly amplified fear, was incredibly beneficial for my psychological well-being.

# The evasion might be cowardly, but it genuinely worked for my mental self-preservation.

The Baseline Mindset: We Will Survive the Worst
Finally, I am eternally grateful to my wife. With her career now stable and thriving, I have a reassuring feeling of security, even in the worst-case scenario.

This allowed me to establish a clear "Baseline Mindset": If I were laid off, the worst outcome is a pay cut. We would have to tighten our belts, and our quality of life would decrease, but we would still survive. It is not the end of the world.

Once this baseline was confirmed, the panic began to subside. I have largely let go of the fear. My perspective has shifted from dread and anxiety to a sense of anticipation for technological progress. I no longer view AI as a job-stealing threat, but as a tool that will bring monumental change and opportunity.

I no longer need to book a therapist. I found my own remedy in time, self-awareness, and a deliberate change of focus.

# Conclusion: Your Mindset Defines Your World

The most profound realization from this entire ordeal is that your mindset dictates everything.

Given the same objective reality—the layoff crisis, the AI revolution—some people subjectively believe, "It's over; we're doomed." Yet, others choose to adjust their focus, live mindfully in the present moment, and transform the crisis into an opportunity. The world won't stop spinning because of your fear, but your personal world will regain hope because of your shift in perspective.
