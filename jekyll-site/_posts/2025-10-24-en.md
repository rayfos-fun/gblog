It's Friday, a time I usually reserve for lighter topics, but somehow my mind always drifts back to kids and education.

Many people assume the "rat race" is just an Asian phenomenon, but the truth is, kids in the U.S. are deep in it, too. Just look around—everyone is pushing. My own kids, for example, are grinding away at math, piano, and swimming.

# A Single Exam vs. Holistic Admissions: Which is Fairer?

Watching them hustle so hard sometimes makes me think back to the old systems we grew up with.

I have a somewhat controversial take: I think a "single, high-stakes exam" system might actually be fairer in a society with vast resource inequality.

Back then, for students who were naturally bright, willing to hit the books hard, and whose families weren't a significant disadvantage, their chances of getting into a top university and achieving a better life were arguably greater than they are today with "holistic admissions."

Why? Because today's "holistic" approach, while seemingly about a well-rounded individual, is often just a proxy for family resources.

Families with means can ensure their kids have access to the best educational resources from day one. In this race, just being academically gifted isn't nearly enough. You have to grind in sports, in the arts, in internships, in leadership... or you'll be left behind.

# When AI Enters the Chat, What's the Point of "the Grind"?

And yet, amid all this pressure to grind in academics and extracurriculars, I've noticed an interesting paradox: American schools place an enormous emphasis on character education. They are constantly talking about SEL (Social and Emotional Learning).

This made me start to wonder, especially with the rapid rise of AI, what the point of all this grinding really is.

The arrival of AI has made me feel that the importance of "mastery" in academics and technical skills, in and of itself, is diminishing.

# Redefining "the Grind": It's Not About the Skill, It's About the Character

After all, AI can calculate faster, draw better, and even play the piano with more precision than most humans. If the end goal of "the grind" is just to master a technical skill, that's a dead-end road AI is rapidly paving over.

So, I've started to redefine what "the grind" means for my own kids. We're still doing the activities, but the purpose has shifted:
* We're grinding at swimming, but the main goal is physical health.
* We're grinding at math, but the main goal is logical reasoning. In the future, AI will provide countless answers, but my kids need the ability to judge whether those answers are right or wrong.
* We're grinding at piano, but the main goal is character building. It's about teaching them that when they encounter something difficult, they can overcome it through persistent effort. That "resilience" is something AI can't replicate.

At the end of the day, maybe we're all still part of "the grind." But we're no longer grinding for that admission ticket to an elite university. We're grinding for something more fundamental: the inner strength for our kids to face the future—a healthy body, a clear mind, and a spirit that won't break when faced with adversity.
