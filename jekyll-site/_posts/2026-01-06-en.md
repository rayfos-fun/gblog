There is no "regret medicine" in life.

In Bronnie Ware's famous book, *The Top Five Regrets of the Dying*, the number one regret is universally haunting: **"I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me."**

I have always believed in a core principle: You must take care of yourself first before you can have the emotional capacity to care for others.

### The Subconscious Saboteur

When you force yourself to pursue a goal solely to satisfy others—be it family expectations or societal pressure—while your heart isn't in it, you are setting yourself up for failure.

Psychologically, your actions will align with your internal resistance to achieve "self-consistency." You might subconsciously hold back effort to prove to yourself that "this isn't what I want" or "this isn't worth it." In the end, you create a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure just to validate your inner feelings.

**Only when you act in alignment with your heart does your subconscious stop resisting and start assisting.**

### Dodging the "Peter Principle"

There was a time when my family expected me to climb the corporate ladder. They wanted the title, the prestige, and the progression. But deep down, I knew it wasn't for me.

Years have passed, and I didn't get that promotion.

Yes, there is a significant difference in salary, but **I have zero regrets.**

I know that if I had fought for a goal I didn't believe in, the process would have been miserable. And even if I had succeeded, I likely would have hit the **"Peter Principle"**—rising to the level of my respective incompetence—trapped in a high-stress role I hated, living a miserable life at the top of a hill I never wanted to climb.

### It's Not Laziness, It's Balance

Some might call my current career path "lying flat" or "quiet quitting," but I prefer to call it genuine **Work-Life Balance.**

* **On the clock:** I am professional. I focus on my work and complete every assigned task on time.
* **Off the clock:** I disconnect. My time is spent on my passions and hobbies, not on scheming how to claw my way to the next tier of management.

The reality is, most corporate structures are pyramids. Not everyone is meant to—or needs to—reach the apex. Companies need reliable employees who do their jobs well and stay until retirement.

Choosing to find stability in your role rather than chasing an endless promotion cycle isn't giving up; it's prioritizing your peace.
