When debating whether to move abroad for work, people often get stuck on the wrong metrics.

If we look strictly at **salary versus cost of living**—using metrics like GDP per capita, Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), or the famous Big Mac Index—the gap between Taiwan and the United States isn't as massive as one might think. In terms of daily living standards, the difference might only be 10% to 20%.

So, is it worth leaving your home, your family, and your culture to become a rootless expat just for that marginal gain?

If you just look at consumption, the answer is probably no. But the math changes entirely when you look at **savings and wealth accumulation**.

### The "Savings Rate" Fallacy

If you live paycheck to paycheck, frankly, the quality of life in Taiwan and the US is comparable. The high cost of rent, insurance, and taxes in the US eats up most of that impressive-looking salary.

**However, if you are saving money, the game changes.**

Let’s look at the absolute numbers. Suppose you manage to save 20% of your income in both places.
* In Taiwan, earning 1 million TWD a year means you save **200,000 TWD**.
* In the US, a comparable role might pay the equivalent of 10 million TWD. Saving 20% of that means you bank **2 million TWD**.

The lifestyle effort is the same, but the asset accumulation is **10 times faster**.

People often say "increasing income" and "reducing expenses" are equally important. I disagree. **Increasing income is king.** You could live frugally in Taiwan, pinching every penny to save 80% of your income, and you'd still end up with less cash in the bank than someone in the US who lives lavishly and saves only 10%.

This leads to the concept of **Geo-arbitrage**. Earning US dollars and spending them back in Taiwan makes you feel financially invincible. Prices that used to feel steep suddenly feel trivial.

### Hardware vs. Software: The Career Ceiling

Beyond the math, my decision to move to the US wasn't just about money. It was about the **industry landscape**.

Taiwan is a global powerhouse, but its strength lies heavily in **Hardware**. Companies like TSMC are world leaders, and if I were a hardware engineer, I'd stay in Taiwan without hesitation.

But I am in **Software**.

Taiwan lacks a critical mass of world-class software giants. In contrast, Silicon Valley is the epicenter of the software universe. The density of top-tier tech companies, the architectural challenges, and the sheer scale of the products are unmatched.

If you want to build a career in software, the US isn't just a better option; it's the only option if you want to play in the major leagues.

That is why I didn't hesitate. I chose the US.
