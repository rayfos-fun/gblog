# The Game Rules: High or Low

The rules for this guessing game are simple: The computer selects a random number between 1 and 1000. Your goal is to guess that number. After each guess, the game tells you if your number was too high or too low. The challenge is to find the correct answer in the fewest attempts possible.

# Binary Search: The Logic Behind the Game

You might wonder why we'd put such a straightforward game on a tech blog. Beyond just being a fun way to kill time, this game is a perfect illustration of a crucial computer science concept: **Binary Search**.

**Binary Search** is an incredibly efficient algorithm whose core idea is to halve the search space with every single step.

For example, with a range from 1 to 1000, your first guess should be the midpoint, 500.

* If the answer is "too high," you instantly narrow the range to 1–499.

* If the answer is "too low," the new range is 501–1000.

No matter the outcome, you've eliminated roughly half of the possibilities.

If you were to guess randomly ignoring hints, or sequentially starting from 1, you would need an average of 500 guesses, and potentially up to 1000 attempts in the worst-case scenario. By consistently applying the Binary Search logic and always guessing the middle value, you can guarantee finding any number within the 1-to-1000 range in a maximum of 10 guesses. That's because 2<sup>10</sup>=1024, which is larger than 1000.

Interestingly, while 10 is the maximum, it turns out that in the vast majority of cases, your luck will be "the worst." If you played the game 1,000 times, you'd find you need 10 guesses about 500 times, 9 guesses about 250 times, 8 guesses about 125 times, and so on. Mathematically, the average number of guesses needed is actually around 9 times, not the midpoint of 5.

# The One-Second Cheat (And Why It Matters)

Now, if you want to cheat and guess the number on your first try, it's very easy. You just need to open your browser's developer console and type in the name of the variable storing the correct number (e.g., *secretNumber*).

While this completely ruins the fun of the game, it provides a valuable lesson in web development: it demonstrates how front-end code works and reminds us that if the core game logic (like the secret number) is stored on the client side (the user's browser), it is trivially easy for players to cheat. This is why critical security and application logic should always reside on the server side.

This simple high-or-low game not only helps you pass the time but also lets you peek into the elegance and power of highly efficient algorithms. Next time you play, try to consciously apply the Binary Search mindset and see if you can beat the clock in 10 moves or less!
