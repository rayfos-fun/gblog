As a software engineer, the core of my daily job boils down to optimizing one primary objective: minimizing unnecessary errors during product development while maintaining acceptable Scalability and Maintainability.

This sounds exactly like a textbook definition of Software Engineering. We rely on knowledge gathered from experience and books—principles like Refactoring, Design Patterns, and Unit Testing—to ensure our code lives longer and runs stably.

However, my learning path diverged from that of many computer science graduates.

# The EE Major’s Approach: Learning by Fire

I graduated with a degree in Electrical Engineering (EE), not Computer Science (CS). As a result, most of my software engineering knowledge wasn't acquired through systematic coursework but through a practical, decentralized approach:

1. Stepping directly into professional "potholes" and mistakes.
2. Guidance from industry books.
3. Online videos and shared experiences from others.

This journey taught me a crucial paradox of learning: Some knowledge is useless until you've lived it.

# The "Theory-Only" Problem: Disconnected from Experience

A textbook will tell you "Unit testing is critical," and a manual will advise "Use the Factory Pattern to improve extensibility." But without relevant practical experience, it's difficult for this knowledge to truly integrate with your daily workflow.

The knowledge remains abstract and easily forgotten. It’s similar to why EMBA programs require work experience—learning theoretical concepts in a vacuum severely diminishes their effectiveness.

# The Value of Pain: The Best Lessons Come with Scars

I found that the concepts that truly stuck with me—the ones I'll never repeat—were those accompanied by "visceral pain" or a strong emotional connection.

* When you haven't worked on a project of several hundred thousand lines of spaghetti code, you cannot truly appreciate the need for maintainability.
* When a lack of proper design patterns means a simple feature update cascades through a dozen modules, forcing you to pull an all-nighter, that is when you gain a visceral understanding of the principle of "High Cohesion, Low Coupling."

These experiences are irreplaceable. They forge strong emotional pathways in your brain, leading to an "A-ha!" moment where the why of the theory suddenly makes undeniable sense, turning abstract concepts into ingrained intuition.

# Advice for New Engineers: Make Practical Experience Part of the Curriculum

While summer internships might not have been widespread in Taiwan during my college days (about two decades ago), I urge today's young engineers to prioritize hands-on experience:

1. Seek Internships Early: Whether at a large company or a small startup, internships are the fastest way to bridge the gap between academic theory and industry practice.
2. Start a Side Project: Build a complete product from scratch (even a simple blog or game). This forces you to confront real-world challenges like version control, deployment, and architecture design.

Being a software engineer is more than just writing code that runs. It's an art, a science, and, most importantly, a battle-tested philosophy of survival learned through making—and surviving—mistakes.
