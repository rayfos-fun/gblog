As the year draws to a close, it's time for the customary retrospective.

Looking back, the thing I'm most proud of this year is finally stepping out of the shadows of a long slump—perhaps a mid-life crisis—and starting this blog.

The journey wasn't linear. In 2023, when AI burst onto the scene amidst endless tech layoffs, I was paralyzed by panic. By 2024, the mental stress had manifested physically; my health deteriorated, and I suffered from frequent, painful gout attacks. But 2025 became my turning point. I finally adjusted my mindset, stopped fearing the wave, and started surfing it. I embraced AI heavily to launch this blogging journey.

Three months in, I’ve found a new rhythm. I’ve successfully "rebooted" myself.

### The AI Revelation

What amazes me most about using AI isn't just the automation; it's that it taps into the collective knowledge of humanity. It possesses imagination and problem-solving capabilities that often surpass my own.

* **Fiction Mondays:** Often, I only have a vague outline or a rough concept. I hand the details over to AI for refinement. The result? It polishes the story so well that even I, the creator, find myself eagerly anticipating the next chapter.
* **Coding Thursdays:** I am not fluent in CSS, JS, or HTML. Without AI, writing a functional web game or tool would take me weeks of struggle and debugging. Now? I state my requirements, and within minutes, the AI generates hundreds of lines of flawless, high-performing code.

Initially, I spent time reviewing and "learning" from the AI-generated code. Over time, however, I realized the AI is trustworthy. Now, I simply test the main features and deploy. I suspect I will never truly "master" these coding languages manually, but with this level of output, does it matter?

In the past, computers were about "one command, one action." Today, AI is about posing a vague question and receiving insightful advice drawn from the sum of human knowledge. It is, without a doubt, a history-defining technology.

Sometimes I muse that if self-iterating silicon-based life forms eventually replace humans, it wouldn't be surprising. Their memory and computational capacity operate on a level we simply cannot match.

### Mind Over Body

Thanks to this shift in mindset, I haven't had a single gout flare-up in 2025. It is a genuine relief and a strong testament to how deeply our mental state influences our physical well-being.

Life experiences this year were also rich. I took my first cruise to see glaciers, finding immense comfort in nature's grandeur. I also learned to crochet, finding peace in the repetitive, creative motion.

Here’s to a sustainable future for this blog, and to a life rebuilt. See you in the next year.
