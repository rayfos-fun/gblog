It started with my daughter. She wanted to try some crafts, so we bought a crochet kit. Naturally, I decided to give it a try myself. I was immediately hooked (pun intended) by the simplicity: just a ball of yarn and a single hook, yet the possibilities seemed endless. It’s a hobby you can pick up anywhere, anytime.

I’m still a beginner—mostly sticking to single crochets, chains, increases, and decreases—but I’ve managed to produce some decent little items. However, the journey hasn't been without its knots.

### The "Black Yarn" Dilemma

My biggest struggle? Black yarn and fluffy yarn. The stitches become practically invisible, and finding the right loop to insert the hook feels like blind luck.

In the beginning, I fell into a classic beginner's trap: **Perfectionism.**

If I missed a stitch or poked the wrong hole, I would stop immediately. In the crochet world, we call it "frogging" (ripping it, *rip-it*, *rip-it* out). I would waste hours undoing my work just to fix a minor flaw.

### Embracing the "Fudge Factor"

Eventually, I realized something important: most mistakes don't matter.

Now, if I miss a stitch, I don't rip it out. I just keep going. I'll add an extra stitch in the next row to balance the count, or decrease one if I have too many. The result? The finished product looks just fine. In fact, that "casual imperfection" gives it character.

Compared to my early days of agonizing over every single loop—where the effort invested was totally disproportionate to the outcome—I am now much more productive and, frankly, happier.

### Quantity Leads to Quality

This experience reminded me of the famous parable from the book *Art & Fear*:

> A ceramics teacher divided his class into two groups.
>
> **Group A (Quantity):** Graded solely on the weight of the pots they produced (50lbs = A, 40lbs = B).
> **Group B (Quality):** Graded only on producing one single, perfect pot.
>
> The result? **The highest quality pots were all produced by the Quantity group.**

Why? Because while the Quality group sat around theorizing about perfection, the Quantity group was busy churning out piles of work—and learning from their mistakes in the process.

### The Engineering Definition of Success

Crochet is a lot like engineering—or life in general.

The definition of engineering is essentially **optimizing output within given constraints** (time, capital, resources). It is not about infinite refinement.

The fatal flaw of perfectionism isn't just that it slows you down. It's that **it denies you the opportunity to learn how to fix mistakes.**

If you restart every time you stumble, you never learn recovery skills. But if you adapt, patch things up on the fly, and keep moving forward, you gain valuable experience that theory can't teach you.

The "wabi-sabi" of crochet—finding beauty in the imperfect flow—is a lesson I'm taking back to my desk. Done is better than perfect.
