As a software engineer, I've cycled through the controversial development loop many of us know well: Uninspired Learning in School -> Forced Learning for Interviews (LeetCode) -> Minimal Application on the Job.

The core question that fuels endless debate remains: Is the high-efficiency algorithmic knowledge we gain from LeetCode actually useful in the real world?

I believe the answer is yes, but the "utility" is often fundamentally misunderstood.

# school vs. Interview Prep: From Rote Memorization to Realization

To be frank, I did not truly grasp Algorithms and Data Structures in college. My motivation was solely to pass exams. I didn't understand the practical necessity of complex structures like the Red-Black Tree and resorted to rote memorization just to survive the tests.

It wasn't until I started grinding LeetCode for interview preparation that the concept truly clicked:

1. The Penalty of Time Complexity: During practice, if I chose the wrong data structure or algorithm, my code would fail with a Time Limit Exceeded error. This provided tangible proof that performance efficiency has real value.
2. Practical Re-learning: When I started recognizing which specific algorithms (like Binary Search, Dynamic Programming) and data structures (Hash Maps, Heaps) were applicable to certain problem types, it felt like an effective, practical re-education of the entire subject.

For me, interview prep was not just an exam; it was a high-intensity application course. It connected abstract knowledge to the concrete demand of solving a problem within given constraints.

# The Real Job: Correctness Trumps Extreme Efficiency

However, once I entered the industry and began handling real business requirements, I discovered a harsh reality: The extreme efficiency taught by LeetCode is rarely used on a day-to-day basis.

Why is this the case?

Actual software development primarily focuses on Business Logic. The priority is Correctness—that the process works as intended—not maximizing runtime efficiency:

* Input Scale: Most business workflows don't involve the immense, real-time data volumes required to justify an $O(log N)$ solution.
* Computation Needs: Few processes require millisecond-level, instantaneous results. Many reports or data processes can even be run sequentially, as the result just sits there, waiting to be reviewed or used hours later.

In this environment, optimizing for O(log N) efficiency is often less important than optimizing for code readability, maintainability, and process correctness. A clear, readable O(N<sup>2</sup>) brute-force solution that everyone on the team can understand and verify is often preferred over an incomprehensible, hyper-optimized O(N log N) algorithm.

# The True Value of LeetCode: Communication and Discipline

So, is the LeetCode grind useless? Absolutely not.

I believe the true value of the preparation lies in two critical areas:

1. High-ROI Investment for Interviews

    Undeniably, it remains the most effective tool for passing technical interviews. The practice trains you to write code with speed, precision, and accuracy. This fundamental coding proficiency translates into overall better efficiency when writing production code.

2. The "True King" of the Interview: Communication

    As a former interviewer, I learned that beyond basic coding skill, communication ability is what truly matters. Top-tier algorithmic knowledge is great, but if a candidate:

    * Fails to clearly understand the interviewer's actual need (the "Why").
    * Fails to ask clarifying questions about constraints before starting.
    * Fails to guide the solution back toward the correct path through discussion.

    Even if they produce perfectly efficient code, they can still fail the interview.

    The True King is the ability to translate abstract technical challenges into clear communication, leading the interaction toward the most appropriate solution. This demonstrates the business judgment and collaboration skills required in the messy real world.

In summary: Algorithms are your martial arts training—you don't use the moves on the street every day, but they build your inner technical strength. Communication, however, is the core strategy you use to win in the real world.
