In the 16th chapter of the novel I'm currently writing, I found myself grappling with **Laplace's Demon**.

For the uninitiated, this concept was introduced by French scholar Pierre-Simon Laplace. He proposed a thought experiment: **If an intellect knew the precise position and momentum of every atom in the universe at a single moment, it could use Newton's laws to reveal the entire history and future of the cosmos.**



### The Horror of Determinism

At first glance, it sounds logical. But it quickly leads to a terrifying conclusion: **Determinism**.

If every atomic interaction is pre-calculated, then free will is an illusion. Our past and future are merely a script that has already been written. It’s a pessimistic, fatalistic worldview that has haunted philosophers for centuries.

Fortunately, Quantum Mechanics—specifically Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle—came to the rescue. The inherent randomness of the quantum world suggests that the future isn't set in stone. The "Demon" was effectively exorcised.

### The "Gifted Kid" Reality Check

Speaking of physics, I have a love-hate relationship with the subject.

Growing up, my idol was Albert Einstein. My elementary school tested my IQ, estimating it at around 130 (top 3%). I thought I was hot stuff. Life was smooth sailing, and I thanked the universe for my genetic lottery win.

Then I grew up and realized: *There is always someone smarter.*

My understanding of physics peaked—and crashed—in my freshman year of college. I barely scraped by with a score in the 60s (out of 100). If my memory serves me right, I nearly failed. That was my wake-up call: **Unless your IQ is pushing 150, don't try to be a pioneer in theoretical physics.**

### The "Four Beasts" of Physics

So, I accepted my fate. I’m not a scientist; I’m a storyteller. And as a storyteller, I don't need to solve equations—I just need to use them for entertainment.

In internet culture, there is a meme about the "Four Beasts of Physics." In my novel, I decided to map these paradoxes to the **Four Symbols of Chinese Mythology** (The Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Black Tortoise). It’s a bit of a stretch, but hear me out:

1.  **Zeno's Turtle** 🐢 -> **The Black Tortoise (Genbu)**
    * The paradox of the turtle that can never be overtaken. It represents the infinite division of space and time, fitting the steady, enduring nature of the Black Tortoise.

2.  **Schrödinger's Cat** 🐱 -> **The White Tiger**
    * A creature existing in a superposition of life and death. The White Tiger often symbolizes power and killing intent—fitting for a cat in a box with a vial of poison.
    
    

3.  **Laplace's Demon** 🐉 -> **The Azure Dragon**
    * Why? Because when I hear "Laplace," I think of the Pokémon **Lapras**. Since Lapras looks like a sea dragon (or a plesiosaur), I’m assigning this all-knowing entity to the Azure Dragon slot.

    

4.  **Maxwell's Demon** 🔥 -> **The Vermilion Bird**
    * This little demon tries to violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics by sorting hot and cold molecules. Playing with heat and entropy? That’s definitely a job for the fiery Vermilion Bird.

### Conclusion: Don't Overthink the Bugs

I use these concepts to add a little flavor to my fiction, not to write a thesis. I don't seek total clarity, just enough "science-adjacent" coolness to make the plot interesting.

Sure, a real physicist would find a hundred bugs in my logic. But I’m okay with that. After all, if the universe allows for quantum uncertainty, surely it can allow for a few plot holes in a web novel.
