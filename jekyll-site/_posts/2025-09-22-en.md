I used to think that owning my own website was a distant, almost unreachable goal. But today, I can proudly announce that my personal blog is officially live! You can find it right here: https://rayfos.fun/gblog

This post isn't about showing off; it's about sharing how, with the powerful assistance of AI, the entire process—from buying a domain to going live—was far simpler than I ever imagined. If you’ve ever entertained a similar idea, I hope my experience can offer some inspiration.

# Simplified Steps: Making Your Website Dream Real

To go from an idea to a live site, I essentially followed these four key steps:

1. Buying the Domain

I chose Namecheap as my domain registrar and purchased the domain rayfos.fun. Namecheap's interface is clean and the pricing is beginner-friendly. Choosing a domain you love is the first step toward building your personal brand.

2. GCP Configuration (The TXT Record)

Next, I moved to Google Cloud Platform (GCP). To prove ownership of the domain to GCP, I had to add a TXT record to my domain's DNS settings. This is essentially an online ID check. I simply copied the specific string of text provided by GCP and pasted it into the relevant section on my Namecheap dashboard.

3. Namecheap DNS Setup

This was the most crucial step. In the Namecheap management panel, I needed to point my domain's DNS service directly to GCP. Specifically, I switched the Name Servers from Namecheap's default settings to the Custom DNS Name Servers provided by Google Cloud. This action links the domain name to the GCP server, ensuring external traffic correctly routes to my website.

4. Waiting for the Certificate

Once the DNS settings were updated, all I had to do was wait. GCP automatically handles the process of requesting and deploying an SSL/TLS certificate for my site. This is what makes my URL start with https (secure) instead of the insecure http. The certificate encrypts data transfer between the site and users. The process can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, but once complete, my website was officially accessible to the world.

The best part? I didn't need to be an expert in every single technical detail. Whenever I hit an unfamiliar snag, I just asked the AI. It provided clear, step-by-step instructions and even code snippets, making every technical hurdle easy to overcome.

So, if you've been putting off your website project because of the perceived "technical barrier," the time to act is now.
