# The Siege Camp

Outside Wan City, Sun Ce's camp was a fortress of grim purpose. A palpable killing aura hung in the damp air, a cacophony of whetstones, battle cries, and the rumble of heavy siege engines moving into position.

Shu Fei, now operating as the artisan "Su Fei," was crouched beside a damaged heavy crossbow catapult. Her coarse artisan's robes were stained with grease and mud, making her indistinguishable from the other laborers. Her heavy toolbox lay open beside her, showing hammers, chisels, and thick ropes. Hidden beneath its false bottom, her high-tech electromagnetic analyzer lay dormant.

Her immediate task was to repair the catapult’s winch—a critical component shattered by enemy stones during a recent probe.

"Faster, Su Fei!" a foreman shouted. "Governor Zhou himself is coming to inspect!"

Shu Fei didn't look up, just grunted an acknowledgment. Her INTJ mind, however, was already far beyond simple 'repair.' While examining the damaged structure, she had auto-completed a full stress analysis. The original design was flawed—the winch's gear-seating angle was too wide, making it prone to cracking under extreme pressure.

She wasn't just fixing it. She was optimizing it.

She took a spare block of iron and a file from her kit and, with a speed and alien precision, began to subtly re-shape the gear's curvature.

"What are you doing?" the foreman scowled, striding over. "I told you to fix it, not re-invent it!"

"This modification will increase the winch's tension tolerance by thirty percent and reduce slippage," Shu Fei replied coolly, her hands never ceasing their steady, powerful work.

"You—" Just as the foreman was about to explode, the sound of new footsteps silenced him.

The tent flap was pushed aside, and two young generals entered.

The Analyst and the Strategist
The one in the lead was a striking youth, all martial-bearing and coiled energy. He was Sun Ce, the "Little Conqueror," his legendary purple beard and green eyes marking him instantly.

But it was the man half a step behind him, dressed in a white scholar's robe, who made Shu Fei’s heart go cold. He was classically handsome, his eyes bright as stars, but the gentle wave of his fan carried an acuity that seemed to dissect everything it saw.

Zhou Yu. Gong Jin.

"When will this be ready for the assault?" Sun Ce demanded, his gaze sweeping impatiently over the half-repaired catapult. "The walls won't wait!"

The foreman bowed hastily. "My lord, Su Fei is just..."

"Wait."

Zhou Yu’s voice was soft, yet held an authority that cut through the noise of the camp. He wasn't looking at the catapult. He had walked straight to Shu Fei, his gaze fixed on the gear she had just modified.

The tent fell utterly silent.

Zhou Yu’s eyes rested on that intricate, perfectly filed piece for three seconds, then rose to meet hers. His gaze was calm, but it felt like a surgeon's scalpel, probing for the truth beneath her mundane exterior.

"You are Su Fei?" he asked.

"Yes, Governor." Shu Fei lowered her eyes, consciously regulating her heartbeat. She knew, instantly, that she had made a classic INTJ error: Over-Optimization. She couldn't resist making the system more efficient, and in doing so, had exposed a level of knowledge far beyond any common "military artisan."

"You altered the winch design," Zhou Yu stated. It was not a question. "Are you aware that unauthorized modification of military equipment is punishable by death?"

Sun Ce frowned, "Gong Jin, she's just an artisan. Perhaps it was a... fortunate accident."

"My lord," Zhou Yu interrupted gently, his eyes never leaving Shu Fei, "one does not 'accidentally' create this kind of 'inward-pull traction' structure. This requires a deep, innate understanding of leverage and material mechanics."

He crouched, picking up the perfectly filed gear, his voice quiet. "Where are you from, Su Fei? Who was your teacher?"

It was a trap. An unanswerable question.

Shu Fei’s mind raced. Lu Rui’s ISTJ warning echoed in her head: 'Don't let them find you.'

"Governor," Shu Fei’s voice was pitched with a note of credible huskiness and nerves. "I... I am from Lujiang. My father was a blacksmith in the city. These... these are just things I picked up watching him tinker with his mechanisms. He always said..." she improvised, grasping for a plausible, folksy explanation. "He always said, 'a gear's secret isn't in its roundness, but in its 'squareness'—that's what gives it bite.'"

She had offered a cryptic piece of artisan's wisdom to mask the precise science behind her work.

Zhou Yu stared at her, saying nothing. The air in the tent was suffocating.

Finally, he smiled.

"'What gives it bite...'" he mused. "A fine answer." He stood up. "You are very talented. And since you are so familiar with defensive equipment, you must also have... unique insights into breaching them."

He unfastened a small, heavy token from his belt and tossed it to her.

"As of now, you are relieved of repair duty," Zhou Yu commanded. "You are reassigned to my Siege Advisory Staff, on immediate call. I need your eyes to find the weaknesses in Wan City's defenses."

Shu Fei caught the cold, heavy token. Her stomach dropped.

This was not a reward. This was a leash.

Zhou Yu's acuity had exceeded her projections. He hadn't exposed her; instead, he had claimed her—this "sharp blade"—and placed her directly under his own supervision, a new, volatile piece on his personal game board.

Her potential obstacle wasn't just a random officer; it was the sharpest strategist in Jiangdong. She had lost her freedom of movement. Every action she took would now be under the piercing gaze of Gong Jin.
