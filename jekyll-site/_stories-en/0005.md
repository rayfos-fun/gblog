# The Desperate Gambit

Liu Bei, holding his Twin Swords, felt a desperate urgency gripping his heart. Outside Hulao Pass, the war drums thundered. Lu Bu's Fangtian Huaji carved arcs of death through the air, unstoppable. Zhang Fei roared, his leopard eyes blazing, the Serpent Spear darting out like a venomous dragon. Guan Yu stood silent on the flank, his phoenix eyes narrowed, the Green Dragon Crescent Blade held steadily, as if merely observing a dull performance.

Liu Bei (the player, Lu Rui) knew the outcome of this duel. The Three Brothers against Lu Bu was destiny; Lu Bu was doomed. But a mad thought surged in his mind: He could not let Lu Bu die.

"Third Brother, no! Hold your temper!" Liu Bei yelled, his voice swallowed by the battlefield's clamor. He frantically sped up the rotation of his Twin Swords, trying to interfere with Zhang Fei’s assault. He had to buy Lu Bu a chance to escape. Lu Bu was the world's hope, the key to the future of technology. Without him alive, Zhuge Liang would disappear, the technological timeline would rupture, and the world would face annihilation.

Lu Bu, witnessing this, was utterly perplexed. Why was this humble mat-weaver desperately trying to protect him? With no time to process, he swung his Halberd, locked in a ferocious tangle with Zhang Fei.

Then, Guan Yu moved.

A chill ran through Liu Bei's heart. He knew that the most fearsome threat was not the tempestuous Zhang Fei, but his usually taciturn Second Brother. Guan Yu’s face was expressionless, but the Green Dragon Crescent Blade had already left his hands. The blade sliced a streak of cold light through the air, heading straight for Lu Bu.

"Second Brother, stop!" Liu Bei cried out, thrusting his Twin Swords towards Guan Yu's incoming Blade. He meant to deflect the attack, to create that sliver of space for Lu Bu’s retreat.

# The Betrayal of the Twin Swords

But Guan Yu’s blade-work was too fast, too dominant. It was not a simple strike; it was the Life-Reaping Soul-Chaser—a technique capable of altering history.

The Green Dragon Crescent Blade ignored Liu Bei's Twin Swords. With a slight, almost imperceptible twist, it bypassed the obstruction and struck Liu Bei’s right forearm with unerring precision.

Clang! A sharp metallic ring. The Twin Swords flew out of Liu Bei’s numb grip, soaring into the air.

Liu Bei felt a jolt of shock travel up his arm. He watched in slow-motion as his own sword arced toward Lu Bu.

Lu Bu, grappling with Zhang Fei, saw the Twin Swords coming and instinctively flinched. However, the sword continued its perfect arc, striking Lu Bu squarely in the chest.

Thud! A dull impact. Lu Bu was knocked backward, flying off his horse and crashing heavily onto the ground.

A wave of dread washed over Liu Bei. It was over. The Twin Swords—the weapon he had intended to use to save the world—had become the instrument of hope’s execution.

He looked at Guan Yu, who stood still, watching him. There was no apology in the Martial Saint’s eyes. Guan Yu knew what his sworn brother was attempting, but he also knew his duty was to the Han Dynasty.

"Brother," Guan Yu said calmly. "Lu Bu is dead. The Han has hope."

Liu Bei sank weakly to his knees, staring at Lu Bu's body, his heart a turmoil of five distinct tastes. He knew that from this moment on, Zhuge Liang would withdraw, technology would fracture, and the world would rush towards oblivion. All because of his dearest Second Brother.

"Second Brother, you..." The words caught in his throat. He knew that the plea, the explanation, could never be uttered now.

He rose, looking at Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, overwhelmed by a profound sorrow. He could never go back. He could never change this history.

All he could do was watch, as this world, guided by the very bond he cherished, marched toward its ultimate doom.
