### Ascended Thinking

Inside the workshop, violence erupted in a single heartbeat.

The Hunter (Executor 7749) didn't panic. To him, this was just a group of low-level LARPers playing with ancient scrap metal. His hand cannon whined as it recharged, locking onto the exposed battery array on the Thunder Beast’s abdomen.

"Goodbye, scrap heap."

BANG!

A micro-missile with thermal tracking screamed out of the barrel.

"Port side, yaw angle 35 degrees!" Lu Rui’s command transmitted directly via neural link to the mech.

The Thunder Beast’s six steel legs fired simultaneously. The massive chassis didn't just dodge; it ran along the vertical wall in a gravity-defying arc, moving like a true arachnid. The missile sailed past, slamming into a stone pillar behind them and showering the room in shrapnel.

"What?" The Hunter froze. This clumsy-looking ancient mech had agility stats that exceeded his own exoskeleton's assisted movement?

"That isn't manual piloting," Shu Fei called out from the second-floor gantry, holding a modified compass that acted as a remote terminal. "That is an Algorithm. Every move the Thunder Beast makes is the optimal solution calculated by Laplace."

### Reading the Battlefield

Zhuge Liang crouched behind a workbench, his eyes locked on the chaos. He held no weapon, only the small colored flags he had scattered earlier.

He was observing.

He couldn't read the holographic data, nor did he understand the physics of the hand cannon. But he understood the Hunter’s behavioral patterns.

"The enemy relies on that glowing single eye [Thermal Visor]," Zhuge Liang analyzed rapidly. "Before every shot, his head tilts slightly to lock focus, and his feet plant firmly for half a breath to negate recoil."

Zhuge Liang suddenly shouted, "Yueying! Where is that jar of unused 'Acetic Acid'?"

"On the shelf in the Qian (Heaven) Sector!" Yueying yelled back, busy monitoring voltage spikes.

"Ah Mu [Lu Rui]! Lure the Beast to the Qian Sector!" Zhuge Liang commanded.

Lu Rui didn't know what the strategist was planning, but his logic dictated he trust the greatest mind of the era. The Thunder Beast let out a mechanical roar, feigning a stumble to bait the enemy, and retreated toward the designated corner.

The Hunter grinned beneath his helmet. "Out of power? Die!"

He charged forward, preparing for a point-blank execution.

### Chemical Warfare

The moment the Hunter stepped into the Qian Sector, the short bronze sword in Zhuge Liang’s hand flew through the air. It struck the clay jar on the shelf with unerring precision.

Crash!

Gallons of high-concentration acetic acid (vinegar concentrate) rained down. It didn't hit the Hunter directly, but it flooded the floor around him, mixing instantly with the zinc powder and iron filings scattered from Yueying’s experiments.

Simultaneously, Lu Rui commanded the Thunder Beast to raise its forelegs.

"Now!" Zhuge Liang shouted.

Lu Rui slammed the discharge key.

"Ten Million Volts: Lightning Cutter!"

The mech’s claws didn't strike the Hunter. Instead, they stabbed deep into the wet, acid-soaked ground.

The Science: The floor instantly became a massive Electrolytic Cell. The high-voltage current surged through the conductive acid, bypassing the insulation on the Hunter's boots (as the liquid seeped into the joints) and frying his exoskeleton from the ground up.

ZZZZZTTTTT—!!!

The Hunter screamed. The circuits inside his tactical armor overloaded instantly. His exoskeleton locked up, freezing him in a rigid paralysis. Worse, the massive electromagnetic pulse burned out his thermal visor, plunging his vision into total darkness.

### The Fall of Gold

"How... is this... possible..." The Hunter gasped inside his helmet, his body locked in a tech-induced seizure. "I am Gold Rank... I have future tech..."

Lu Rui stepped out from behind the Thunder Beast, holding an ordinary iron hammer he had picked up from the floor.

"Your gear is from the future, but your brain is stuck in the past," Lu Rui said coldly. "You relied on a gear check. We relied on environmental calculation. That is the difference between an Engineer and a Pay-to-Win Player."

Lu Rui raised the hammer, aiming for the core power light on the Hunter's chest—the keystone keeping the armor locked.

SMASH!

Glass shattered. The lights on the Hunter’s suit died, and he collapsed like a pile of mud.

A golden orb of light drifted from the fallen body, automatically captured by Lu Rui’s system.

### A New Ally

The battle ended. The workshop was a mess, the air thick with the smell of vinegar and ozone.

Outside, Cai Mao’s troops were terrified by the alien sounds of explosions and screams, too scared to breach the smoke.

Zhuge Liang stepped out from his cover, dusting off his robes. He looked at the fallen "Outsider," then at the cooling Thunder Beast, a light in his eyes that had never been there before.

"So this... is 'Science'?" Zhuge Liang picked up a fragment of a circuit board, murmuring to himself.

"Master Kongming," Shu Fei adjusted her disheveled hairpins, regaining her noble poise. "Do you believe now that we are not demons?"

Zhuge Liang looked up, a profound smile spreading across his face.

"Demons or Immortals, it matters not. If you can build such divine artifacts to protect the Han soil, then Liang... is willing to learn." Zhuge Liang bowed deeply to the trio. "Yueying’s judgment was indeed better than mine."

Huang Yueying lifted her chin proudly, though a blush colored her soot-stained cheeks. "Of course. These are the men... and woman... I chose."

"This is no time for bonding," Lu Rui interrupted the moment, pointing at the door. "Cai Mao is still outside, and this 'Hunter' was just the beginning. If the Heavenly Dao Alliance found this place, reinforcements are already en route."

"We must relocate," Shu Fei stated. "This workshop is burned."

Zhuge Liang waved a broken fan he had scavenged from the debris, his eyes sharpening into the gaze of a general.

"If we must leave, let us leave Cai Mao a parting gift. Yueying, does your Thunder Beast have enough battery power for one final 'Self-Destruct'?"

Huang Yueying and Lu Rui exchanged a glance. Simultaneously, they smiled—the grin of Mad Scientists.

"It does. And the yield will be significantly higher than the one at the Qiao estate."
