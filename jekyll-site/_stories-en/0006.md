# The Unconventional Strategy

"This time, I have the assurance." Lu Rui stated calmly, a tone of uncompromising resolve in his voice.

"Choose your character, and do not concern yourself with mine." Lu Rui repeated, with a strange confidence, as if the conclusion was already a confirmed theorem.

Shu Fei raised an eyebrow, clearly surprised by his decision. Yet, a deep, unfathomable light flickered in Lu Rui's eyes, half-obscured by his glasses.

Shu Fei offered no further comment. The two entered their respective immersion pods.

The familiar scent of the battlefield rushed in: war drums thundered, and steel shrieked against steel. Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei were locked in a desperate struggle with Lu Bu. Lu Rui’s gaze, sharp and fierce, swept over the chaos. He had not chosen any of the legendary heroes, opting instead to embody Lu Bu’s mount—the legendary Red Hare steed.

This was a daring gamble, the result of Lu Rui’s meticulous calculus. He knew that to truly alter the trajectory of history, one could not adhere to the conventional rules.

Having run this simulation countless times, Lu Rui instantly recognized the sequence. He seized the moment, controlling the Red Hare to nimbly dodge a stray tripping stone that flew up from the melee.

"Third Brother, unleash the Furious Python Soul-Eater!" Liu Bei (Lu Rui's previous avatar) shouted, frantically wielding his Twin Swords to feign coordination with Zhang Fei.

Guan Yu’s Green Dragon Crescent Blade was already airborne, slicing through the air straight toward Lu Bu.

A cold dread settled in Lu Rui’s heart. This was the critical failure point of the last simulation. He swiftly calculated the Blade’s trajectory and the angle of Liu Bei’s Twin Swords. In this moment, he had to become Lu Bu’s third eye, guiding him to survival.

The Red Hare moved with incredible agility, carrying Lu Bu out of the path of Guan Yu’s fatal strike. The Crescent Blade whistled past Lu Bu's cheek, stirring a chilling gust of wind.

"Good horse!" Lu Bu exclaimed in genuine surprise. He felt as if the warhorse beneath him possessed a will of its own, actively steering him clear of danger.

"Second Brother, use the ultimate Azure Dragon Moon-Slayer!" Liu Bei yelled in rising panic, aware that if Lu Bu escaped, the consequences would be dire.

Lu Rui’s vision locked onto the periphery of the battle—a small, unassuming trail easily overlooked in the surrounding melee. He focused his entire will; this time, it wasn't about evading attacks, but about a full-power breakout.

The drumming of hooves was like thunder. The Red Hare, with unstoppable momentum, carried Lu Bu through the perimeter of the Three Brothers. Zhang Fei’s spear, Guan Yu’s blade, and Liu Bei’s frantic Twin Swords could not halt the divine steed’s charge.

"Lu Bu, where do you run!" Zhang Fei roared in pursuit, but the Red Hare’s speed was overwhelming. They were quickly left behind in the dust.

A wave of relief finally washed over Lu Rui. He had succeeded. Lu Bu lived, and the course of history was finally reset to the correct path.

Yet, on the battlefield, the pattering of hooves faded into the distance, vanishing into the yellow dust.

Liu Bei stared blankly at the path of Lu Bu’s escape, utterly lost. Guan Yu and Zhang Fei halted their pursuit, their faces etched with disbelief and frustration at this colossal blunder.

The pattering of those hooves wrought a beautiful mistake. I am not the homeward-bound traveler; I am the steed.
