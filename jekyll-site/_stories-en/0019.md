### Asking the Ghosts, Not the Gods

The stone door crashed open.

A young man, eight feet tall with a face like jade, slipped inside. He wore no legendary crane-feather cloak, only simple linen robes. In his hand, there was no feather fan, but a short bronze sword drawn for self-defense.

This was Zhuge Liang—the Sleeping Dragon before his ascent—and right now, he looked rather ragged.

But his first reaction upon entering the room shocked everyone.

Faced with spectral blue holographic data floating in the air, a massive metal spider, and three people who clearly didn't belong in this timeline, Zhuge Liang froze for exactly one instant—perhaps half a second. Then, immediately, he recovered the calm composure of a mountain collapsing before his eyes without blinking.

"I knew it." Zhuge Liang quickly slammed the stone door shut and jammed a heavy iron bolt into place. "Yueying always said she would build a 'Divine Machine' that surpassed the era. It turns out she wasn't speaking in dreams."

He looked at Lu Rui (Ah Mu) and Shu Fei (Lady Cai), his gaze piercing. "You two are strangers. But since you can stand in a room with Yueying without being electrocuted, you must be kindred spirits."

"You aren't surprised?" Shu Fei raised an eyebrow. she had expected to waste precious minutes explaining the situation.

"Is being surprised useful?" Zhuge Liang moved rapidly to the workbench, eyeing the copper wiring. "The 'Outsider' at the gate holds an iron tube that spits black fire. It can punch through iron armor from a hundred paces. Compared to that instrument of slaughter, your room full of lights and shadows seems positively benevolent."

An iron tube spitting black fire?

Lu Rui’s heart skipped a beat. A matchlock? A flintlock? This was severe Technological Contamination. This wasn't a casual tourist; this was an extremist here to "butcher" the timeline.

"The man claims to be a distant nephew of Sima Hui, but I checked the genealogy; he doesn't exist," Zhuge Liang spoke with rapid-fire precision. "He bewitched General Cai Mao, claiming the Huang estate harbors demons and plots treason. That fool Cai Mao believed him and has surrounded the workshop with crossbowmen."

### The Pressure of Gold

BOOM—!!

A deafening explosion cut the conversation short. The heavy stone door shook violently, dust and gravel raining down.

"That's Black Powder," Lu Rui smelled the sulfur. "The Han Dynasty only has primitive powder for alchemy. It shouldn't have the force for directional blasting. The enemy came prepared."

From beyond the door, a voice—processed through a metallic modulator—echoed through the cracks:

"Listen, 'Rats' inside. I am Executor 7749 of the 'Heavenly Dao Alliance.' You are illegally altering a historical node. You have ten seconds to surrender and hand over the Core Data. Otherwise—Purge."

"Heavenly Dao Alliance?" Shu Fei sneered. "Sounds like one of those guilds that claims to fight for justice but really just wants to monopolize the future."

A system prompt flashed before Lu Rui’s eyes: [WARNING: High-Level Player Signal Detected. Estimated Rank: GOLD.] [Enemy Equipment: Single-soldier Thermal Weaponry (Gunpowder Class), Exoskeleton Assist (Probable).]

"Gold against Bronze?" Lu Rui gritted his teeth. "That's not fair."

"There is no fairness on the battlefield," Zhuge Liang cut in, pointing at the dormant Thunder Beast. "Can this thing move yet?"

"I'm one step away from grid integration!" Huang Yueying was sweating profuseley, jamming the final bank of voltaic piles into the mech's abdomen. "But I need time to calibrate the voltage!"

"I will buy you time." A gleam of sharp intelligence flashed in Zhuge Liang's eyes. He pulled several small colored flags from his sleeve and tossed them to different corners of the workshop. "Yueying, is this workshop laid out according to the 'Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams'?"

"Obviously!"

"Good." Zhuge Liang turned to Lu Rui. "Brother Ah Mu, open the ventilation shafts over there. Lady Cai, please lend me that expensive fan of yours."

### The Bagua Array: Indoor Edition

The stone door detonated again. This time, the slab cracked open, leaving a gaping hole.

A man charged in. He wore black tactical armor disguised as Han iron plating and wielded a crude but lethal Hand Cannon. This was the Hunter.

Behind him swarmed Cai Mao’s elite soldiers.

However, the moment they breached the workshop, they found the room shrouded in mist.

Zhuge Liang had utilized the convection from the vents, combined with the welding smoke already in the room, to create a localized fog of war.

"Cheap tricks," The Hunter scoffed. He raised his hand cannon, preparing to fire blindly.

"Sector Qian (Heaven). Three steps. Rockfall," Zhuge Liang’s clear voice echoed through the mist.

Lu Rui (Ah Mu) yanked a lever beside him.

Crash! A basket of heavy scrap gears dropped precisely from the ceiling, smashing into the ground to the Hunter’s left, forcing him to dodge right.

"Sector Dui (Lake). Seven steps. Shock."

Shu Fei (Lady Cai) threw a copper rod connected to a live wire into the water trough on the right.

Zzzzt!

The Hunter stepped into the puddle just as the rod hit. The current raced up his metal greaves. His tactical suit had insulation layers, but the two Cai Mao soldiers following him screamed as they collapsed, seizing violently.

"Damn it!" The Hunter roared. "What sorcery is this?"

"It is not sorcery," Zhuge Liang’s voice drifted, impossible to pinpoint in the fog. "It is Science. Though I only just learned the word."

### Awakening the Beast

Infuriated, the Hunter tapped his helmet, activating his Thermal Imaging Visor. The fog instantly became transparent in his vision. He saw the four heat signatures hiding behind the massive spider.

"Found you." He raised the hand cannon. The muzzle glowed red—pre-igniting a high-explosive round.

"Die, BUG."

At that exact second, Huang Yueying, who had been silent, screamed: "Link Complete! Lu Rui!"

Lu Rui did not hesitate. He slammed his hand onto the activation rune.

[Software Injection: 100%] [Hardware Link: Stable] [Energy Output: PEAK]

The metal spider, previously dead weight, suddenly emitted a sound like a low-frequency roar.

Its eight legs, forged of refined steel, contracted violently, and then—Launched.

BOOM!

The massive Thunder Beast moved with an agility that defied physics, landing squarely between the group and the Hunter. The high-explosive round struck the mech's front armor, blooming into a fireball, but leaving only a shallow scorch mark.

At the moment of impact, an Electromagnetic Field generated by the mech's surface had deflected the brunt of the shrapnel.

"Target Locked." The mech's vocal unit—a copper horn—emitted a synthesized, electronic voice.

Huang Yueying jumped up in excitement. "It's alive! It's really alive!"

Lu Rui looked at this monster—a fusion of ancient clockwork, future algorithms, and Cyberpunk aesthetics. He pushed up his phantom glasses and stared down the dumbfounded Gold Player.

"You said you were here to clear the BUGs?"

The Thunder Beast raised its two forelegs. Blue electric arcs gathered at the tips, screaming like a thousand chirping birds.

"I regret to inform you," Lu Rui said coldly. "We are now the System Administrators."
