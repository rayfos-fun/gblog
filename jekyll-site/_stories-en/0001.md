# The God of War

I rode the Red Hare, a streak of flowing fire, blazing across a battlefield churning with yellow dust. The Eighteen Feudal Lords—ha! A flock of barnyard chickens, nothing more. They failed to muster even the slightest interest for me to lift my Jǐ (Halberd). The black-gold armor I wore was the finest in the world, and the pheasant plumes on my purple-gold crown trembled in the wind, seemingly joining me in mocking this rabble. I held the Fangtian Huaji (Sky-Piercing Halberd) with one hand, its tip still slick with the blood of some nameless general I’d just dispatched. I reveled in this feeling: gazing down upon all beneath the heavens, the sole master of the world.

A general in silver armor charged out, shouting a challenge for a duel to the death. Gongsun Zan? I could not be bothered to recall his name. The spear in his hand fluttered harmlessly, like a child playing with a bamboo stick. I didn't even need to draw upon my inner Qi; a few subtle maneuvers of my Halberd were enough to throw his spear-work into complete chaos. In fewer than five passes, his face had turned ghost-white, his eyes brimming with naked terror. I scoffed, ready to end him with a single thrust, when a sudden, thunderous roar ripped through the air:

“Treacherous slave with three surnames! Do not harm my brother!”

The sheer internal power contained within that bellow vibrated my eardrums. I followed the sound and saw a dark-faced giant—leopard’s head, ringed eyes, a fierce tiger’s jaw, and a bristling moustache—dressed in plain cloth, wielding an Eighteen-Foot Serpent Spear. He rode a common black horse, yet emanated an untamed, savage aura.

Zhang Fei? Hmph, judging by his look, he was nothing but a butcher.

But when his Serpent Spear tore toward me with a surging, mountain-toppling force, my heart suddenly went cold. This brute strength—even I could not afford to dismiss it. My Halberd was nimble and overbearing; his Spear was violently raw and unmatched in its ferocity. Our weapons clashed madly in the air, producing deafening sounds of tortured metal. After more than fifty rounds, I felt a spark of long-absent exhilaration. This Zhang Fei, devoid of any formal martial arts structure, was blessed with a rare, natural divine strength.

# The Unbeatable Trinity

Just as I was locked in furious combat with the dark-faced giant, a second man entered the fray. He rode a crimson steed, with a red face and a long, magnificent beard. His presence was calm and dignified. The Green Dragon Crescent Blade in his hand lay still as a deep lake, yet concealed an abyss of killing intent.

This was Guan Yu.

His blade-work was entirely different from Zhang Fei’s crudeness. Every strike was imbued with the profound grace of true martial arts; seemingly slow, yet quick as lightning. He and Zhang Fei worked together flawlessly: one hammered relentlessly from the front, the other flanked and constrained from the side. Pinned between the two, my Halberd could no longer be wielded with reckless abandon. Sweat began to bead on my forehead. This level of pressure was something I hadn't felt in a very long time.

Just as I was contemplating how to counter their synchronized assault, a third man joined in, his swords flashing. He was slender, plainly dressed, and his pair of Twin Swords were utterly unremarkable. Yet, his sword-work was light as willow floss, seemingly lacking power, but always managed to find the exact, perfect moment—in the middle of my move transitions—to deliver a subtle prick. Though never fatal, these light jabs were enough to disrupt the flow of my internal Qi.

This Liu Bei, though his martial skill was mediocre, complicated this brutal fight immensely by his very presence.

Three currents of energy, three distinct approaches, perfectly integrated. One with insurmountable brute force, one with exquisite blade mastery, and one with subtle, fluid dexterity. Their coordination formed an invisible net that trapped me. Even with my peerless ability, I could not defeat these three brothers united by a single heart.

My eyes hardened. I feigned a move, pulled my Halberd back, and spurred my horse away.

This was not fear. It was the realization that this battle no longer held any meaning for me. The three of them did not rely on singular martial prowess, but on the profound bond of their brotherhood—a power that my own martial arts could never touch.

With a mixture of unwillingness and reluctant respect, I made my retreat. These three nameless heroes had shown me today that there was, after all, a force in the world stronger than being "The First Under Heaven."
