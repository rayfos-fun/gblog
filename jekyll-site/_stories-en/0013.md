### A-Plot: The Data Transfer

nside Qiao Xuan's study, the air seemed to have solidified.

The old scholar was trembling, not with rage, but with profound shock. He stared at Lu Rui as if he were looking at a phantom. "You… how in the world could you know about the corrosion?"

"Elder Qiao, who knows is no longer important," Lu Rui (ISTJ) remained perfectly calm, his steady tone projecting absolute reliability. "What matters is, what do you intend to do with this knowledge?"

Lu Rui pressed directly to the heart of the matter. "You activated the Qimen Dunjia to defend the city for one reason: to stall for time, to wait for a 'worthy master' to whom you could entrust your life's work. But he is not coming. Yuan Shu is a fool, Cao Cao is a tyrant, and Sun Ce..."

"Sun Ce and Zhou Yu," a flash of pain crossed Qiao Xuan's eyes, "they are dragons among men, but they are too young, too ambitious. They will turn this knowledge into the ultimate weapon, not the bedrock of civilization."

"Which is why you need a fourth option," Lu Rui said.

"A fourth option?"

"Give it to me." From his simple merchant's bundle, Lu Rui retrieved an inconspicuous tool—an "Imprinting Box". It was a device composed of dozens of metallic plates, each as thin as a cicada's wing and etched with hyper-precise, complex grooves.

"This is...?"

"A secret art, passed down in my family," Lu Rui began his pre-rehearsed cover story. "It cannot copy your bronze machines. But, through a process of 'molecular resonance,' it can imprint the structural data stored within their mechanical cores."

Lu Rui had successfully disguised his high-tech scanner as an ancient, esoteric imprinting tool.

A brilliant light flashed in Qiao Xuan's eyes. He understood. This merchant represented another, completely unknown technological power.

"How long will the data transfer take?" Qiao Xuan asked.

"At least four hours. And it cannot be interrupted," Lu Rui replied. "I will need you to personally operate the 'celestial sphere' to cycle through the core data sets."

"Four hours..." Qiao Xuan glanced outside, the faint sound of Sun Ce's war drums rolling in. "Zhou Yu's patience will not last even one hour."

"I know," Lu Rui said, adjusting his glasses. "That's why I am here."

"You?" Qiao Xuan looked at him, puzzled.

"No," Lu Rui corrected. "My partner is."

### B-Plot: The Delaying Tactic

Sun Ce's command tent.

Zhou Yu was watching Shu Fei (Su Fei) with keen interest, awaiting her reaction to his "fire" proposal.

Shu Fei’s (INTJ) mind was racing. She knew she could not deny his plan—that would be tantamount to admitting hostility. She had to agree with him, and then, redirect that plan down a more complex and time-consuming path.

"The Governor's insight is brilliant," Shu Fei bowed. "Using fire to counter water is, indeed, the superior strategy for breaking a mechanism."

Zhou Yu smiled faintly. "Then in your opinion, as an artisan, how should we apply the fire?"

"That is precisely the difficulty," Shu Fei interjected smoothly, pointing to the river model on the sand table. "Qiao Xuan's power system is deep underground. Any normal fire arrow or pitch will be extinguished by the rushing water or blocked by the steam before it ever reaches the core."

She had successfully established the first technical obstacle to Zhou Yu's "brilliant plan."

"Then what do you propose?" Zhou Yu's interest only deepened.

"If this system is water-powered, it must have ventilation shafts and exhaust ports," Shu Fei's analysis was flawless. "Otherwise the hydraulic pressure would collapse the tunnels. We don't need to burn the water; we need to..."

Her eyes flashed with a cold light. "Find those hidden vents. Pour a precise mixture of naphtha and sulfur down them, directly onto the core axles of the water wheels!"

"Excellent!" Sun Ce slammed his fist on the table. "That settles it! Gong Jin, give the order! Have the men find those vents!"

"My lord, wait," Zhou Yu raised a hand, silencing him. He stared at Shu Fei. "Su Fei, where are these vents?"

Shu Fei's heart tightened. The real test was here.

"I don't know," she answered honestly. "But I would deduce they are hidden in the most defensible, yet most overlooked, places. For example..." She pointed to spots on the sand table. "Abandoned drainage ditches, the base of the censer in the city temple, perhaps even... that bamboo grove in the Qiao manor's back garden."

Zhou Yu smiled. He didn't want the answer; he wanted the analytical process.

"Good," he said, looking at her. "I am giving you a ten-man squad, with my best scouts. Before the final assault begins, I want you to personally go and find every single one of those 'ventilation shafts'."

Shu Fei’s heart sank.

She had succeeded. She had just bought Lu Rui the time he needed—the time it would take to find the vents.

But she had also failed. Zhou Yu had once again turned her own blade against her. She was no longer a "staff advisor"; she was a "field operative," and she would be doing the legwork for Sun Ce's final attack.

"As you command, Governor." She accepted the new token he offered—"Scouting Vanguard." She knew she now had to walk the knife's edge of Wan City, all under Zhou Yu's watchful gaze.
