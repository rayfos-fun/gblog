# Debriefing: The Nine Points of Victory

The chilled lid of the immersion pod slowly lifted. Lu Rui straightened his body from the reclining position and drew a deep breath. The residual scent of battlefield blood and horse dust seemed to linger in his sinuses before being chased away by the cool, sterile air of the room.

He pushed up his glasses, a slight upturn at the corner of his mouth.

"Success." He murmured to himself.

This "success" wasn't about defeating an enemy, but about successfully pulling Lu Bu out of the clutches of death. The global catastrophe of technological collapse, averted by the improbable means of a single horse.

He checked the display on his wrist. Since embarking on this grand historical correction project, his in-game ranking points had been pathetically low, much like his actual rank: Bronze. After all, his actions were never about achieving victory, but about 're-aligning' history.

This time, however, a small prompt flashed across the screen: Personal Score +9.

A wave of quiet satisfaction washed over Lu Rui. These nine points were an affirmation of his meticulous calculation and his willingness to break the rules. Though the "Challenger" rank was still light-years away, he knew he was doing something far more meaningful than simply chasing a win.

# The Unconventional Horse Gambit

Just then, footsteps approached. Shu Fei walked over in her black tracksuit. Her cold, severe aura was undiminished, yet her eyes held a flicker of rare astonishment.

"I genuinely didn't expect it," Shu Fei said, folding her arms, a hint of barely suppressed curiosity in her voice. "You actually chose the Red Hare."

Lu Rui adjusted his glasses over the bridge of his nose, smoothing out his plain gray T-shirt. "To alter the most entrenched historical node, one must exploit the smallest, most easily ignored variable." He explained, his tone level and precise. "The strength of the Three Brothers is a fixed constant, insurmountable. But the Red Hareâ€™s mobility is a variable independent of the warrior's skill."

Shu Fei nodded, a rare trace of approval on her face. "Your logic is flawless. The ISTJ pragmatism, combined with a touch of INTJ unconventional creativity."

"It's less about creativity, and more about avoiding another global collapse," Lu Rui replied dryly.

Locking Down the Next Battlefield
The two instinctively shifted the conversation to the next target. With Lu Bu's successful escape, Dong Zhuo's faction would gain a reprieve, pushing history into a new, unstable phase.

"Where do you intend to focus next?" Shu Fei asked.

Lu Rui paused in thought, rapidly sketching out the new strategic landscape in his mind. "Our goal is to ensure the seeds of technology are successfully nurtured. That requires a stable platform capable of attracting top talent."

"If Lu Bu lives, the Dong Zhuo faction will last longer. We should either ensure talent doesn't flee, or back a force that can hasten the end of the chaos." Shu Fei analyzed.

Lu Rui tapped his fingers twice in the air, a flash of insight in his eyes. "No. I believe we should focus on Jiangdong (East of the Yangtze River)."

Shu Fei was slightly taken aback. "Jiangdong? The Sun family?"

"Precisely. They possess the most advanced foundation in shipbuilding, metallurgy, and astronomy. If isolated, their technological regression will be minimal." Lu Rui confirmed, his voice solidifying the conclusion. "Furthermore, a crucial figure is set to emerge there soon."

"And who might that be?"

"Our next main battlefield," Lu Rui concluded, his eyes already filled with the calculations of the coming maneuver, "is set for Wan City in Jiangdong."
