### B-Plot: The Navigation to Nowhere

The outskirts of Wan City were draped in ink-black darkness.

Shu Fei walked at the head of the column, holding a detection torch high. Behind her, ten elite Jiangdong scouts followed like shadows. Leading them was a young colonel with a grim, stone-cold face: Ding Feng.

Shu Fei knew the name. A future general of Eastern Wu. Though young now, his eyes already held the alertness of a hunting hound.

"Master Su," Ding Feng spoke, his hand resting on the hilt of his saber. "This is the third circle we have walked. The City Temple is directly ahead. Why are we turning?"

Shu Fei stopped. She crouched down, grabbed a handful of dirt, and rubbed it between her fingers.

"Colonel Ding, do you understand hydro-engineering?" she asked coldly, using her professional barrier to suppress his doubt.

Ding Feng frowned. "No. But I understand military orders. The Governor wants the vents marked now."

"Precisely because we need speed, we cannot afford errors." Shu Fei stood up, dusting off her hands. "When the underground aqueducts are active, they generate significant thermal exhaust. If this were a vent site, the surrounding soil would be warm and humid. But this soil..." she paused for effect, "is cold."

She lied. It was just the standard surface temperature of a cool night.

"If we pour the naphtha here, the backflow will not only fail to reach the core but will likely blow us to pieces." Shu Fei pointed in a new direction—towards a wasteland far from the Qiao Manor. "The true vent must be in the low-lying depression over there."

Ding Feng stared at her for a long, uncomfortable moment. Finally, he waved his hand. "Move out. This is the last detour."

Shu Fei breathed a silent sigh of relief. She had successfully bought another hour. But glancing at the map in her hand, anxiety gnawed at her: her fabricated "scientific deductions" were systematically eliminating all wrong answers, forcing the squad inevitably toward the only logical truth—the bamboo grove in the Qiao Manor's backyard.

### A-Plot: Resonance and Lies

Inside the Qiao Manor study, a spectral blue light flickered in the shadows.

The "Imprinting Box" in Lu Rui’s hands had unfolded, extending countless invisible fiber-optic probes into the crevices of the bronze armillary sphere. A low-frequency hum filled the air—the sound of the high-tech scanner performing "molecular resonance."

Progress: 34%.

Qiao Xuan watched the scene with obsessive fascination. He had studied mechanisms his entire life, yet he had never witnessed such a precise "tool."

"Is this... the lost art of the Mohists?" Qiao Xuan murmured, reaching out to touch the blue light.

"Don't touch it," Lu Rui commanded sharply. "This is the flow of 'Qi.' If you interrupt it, the data stream will collapse."

Just then, urgent knocking pounded on the door.

"Master! Master!" It was the steward, Qiao Fu, his voice laced with panic. "Outside... there is movement from the army! And... what is that strange humming sound inside the study?"

It was the cooling fan of the scanner ramping up.

Lu Rui’s eyes went cold. His hand drifted to the stun baton at his waist. If Qiao Fu barged in, Lu Rui would have to use force, but that would startle Qiao Xuan and likely scrub the mission.

"Elder Qiao," Lu Rui whispered intensely, "I am saving the spark of civilization. Let no one enter."

Qiao Xuan took a deep breath, snapping out of his technological trance. He turned to the door and unleashed a furious roar:

"Get out! I am calibrating the Heavenly Machine! Anyone who dares enter will be sacrificed to the gears!"

Outside, Qiao Fu squeaked in terror. "Yes... yes, Master. Please appease your anger."

The footsteps retreated. Lu Rui released his grip on the weapon, his back slick with cold sweat.

Progress: 42%. Too slow.

### The Crisis: The Ultimatum

Wan City outskirts. The Central Command Tent.

Zhou Yu watched the last grain of sand fall through the hourglass. He sighed softly.

"The hour is up," Zhou Yu said to his orderly. "Has Su Fei signaled yet?"

"Report, Governor. Not yet. Colonel Ding messaged that Master Su is currently conducting... 'soil thermal analysis.'"

"Soil thermal analysis?" Zhou Yu smiled—a cold, knowing smile that saw right through the charade. "A clever stalling tactic. She is dragging her feet to save the city."

Zhou Yu stood, waving his feather fan to issue the final ultimatum.

"Relay the order to Ding Feng. I don't care what Su Fei is analyzing. In fifteen minutes, if I do not see the target signal, commence a carpet fire-bombing on the Qiao Manor. I would rather burn the wrong target than let the right one escape."

Simultaneously, deep in the wasteland, the communicator at Shu Fei’s waist vibrated. It was a system notification, an urgent code from Lu Rui:

[Progress 50%. I need more time.]

A second later, Ding Feng received Zhou Yu’s order. He drew his combat saber and rested the cold steel against Shu Fei’s neck.

"Master Su," Ding Feng’s voice was devoid of emotion. "The Governor has spoken. If the vents are not found within fifteen minutes, we burn the Qiao Manor to the ground. Do you wish to guide us now, or do you wish to die here first as a traitor who misled military intelligence?"

Shu Fei looked at the gleaming blade, then at the dark silhouette of the bamboo grove in the distance.

She was out of cards.

To save Lu Rui from being incinerated blindly, she had to lead them there. But leading them there meant guiding the fire directly to Lu Rui’s location.

"Let's go." Shu Fei closed her eyes, pointing toward the bamboo grove. "I know where it is now."

She had to gamble. She was betting everything that Lu Rui could finish that damn scan one second before the fire arrived.
