# The Ebbing Tide of War

What kind of era was this? A time of heroes and warlords, a reckless age where life was squandered for ambition. The air was thick with the twin scents of blood and churned earth, as if even the birds in the sky were stained with the intent to kill. Outside Hulao Pass, the ferocious struggle between three figures and a single unmatched champion had just ceased. Dust billowed, and the setting sun bled crimson.

Lu Bu, the War God hailed as "the foremost man under heaven," sat atop the Red Hare, his breath coming in ragged, bovine gasps. Blood beads slowly dripped from the blade of his Fangtian Huaji, mixing with the dust on the ground. His gaze remained arrogant, yet a rare flicker of fatigue crossed his brow.

Opposite him, Guan Yu’s Green Dragon Crescent Blade pointed obliquely toward the earth. The dragon pattern etched into the blade shimmered menacingly in the fading light. He stood motionless, like a bronze deity—a monument of unyielding stillness. Zhang Fei, meanwhile, roared ceaselessly beside him, his Serpent Spear still trembling, as if craving the madness of close-quarters combat.

Just as Lu Bu prepared to raise his whip again, determined to settle the score with these three rivals, the abnormality occurred. The Red Hare, the divine horse capable of traversing a thousand li in a day, suddenly found one of its four hooves sink into a patch of soft, loose soil, disturbed by the chaos of the duel.

A piercing neigh sliced through the silence. The Red Hare's foreleg gave way, and it crashed heavily to its knees.

Lu Bu was caught completely off guard. His body lurched forward, and he barely avoided being thrown from the saddle.

# The Silent Strike

In that precise, suspended instant, Guan Yu moved.

There was nothing superfluous in his action; it was as if he had already anticipated the exact millisecond of this collapse. The Green Dragon Crescent Blade ceased to be a heavy weapon in his hands and transformed into a bolt of lightning tearing through the air. The blade carved a flawless, soundless arc, a line of cold brilliance aimed straight for its target.

Everything happened too fast. Lu Bu, still struggling to regain his posture, only managed to raise the shaft of his Halberd in a desperate, last-second block.

But it was too late.

He felt a sudden, blinding pain, followed by a sickening sensation as his vision spun madly. It finally settled on the grotesque image of his own headless torso, still slumped upon the kneeling Red Hare.

The crimson steed remained on its knees, its eyes filled with confusion and profound sorrow. And Guan Yu, the man later known as the Martial Saint, simply retrieved his weapon, his gaze fixed impassively upon the severed head on the ground.

The wind swept down from Hulao Pass, carrying the unique desolation of the battlefield. The end of a legend had come, so quiet and so abrupt. Only the Red Hare’s mournful neigh and the blood-soaked yellow earth remained, silently bearing witness to the close of a heroic age.
