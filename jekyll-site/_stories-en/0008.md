# The Gray Timeline

Shu Fei’s gaze was sharp, locking onto Lu Rui as if to bore through his glasses and probe his intentions.

"You mentioned Wan City because you are anticipating a repeat of the last 'Failed Blooming'," Shu Fei stated, her tone calm but carrying a devastating weight.

Lu Rui did not deny it, patiently waiting for her analysis.

"In our previous failed attempt to disrupt the 'Interlocking Strategy,' the Elder Qiao was not captured by Sun Ce and Zhou Yu. Instead, he utilized his mastery of Qimen Dunjia (Mystical Gates and Hidden Jias) to defend Wan City." She paused. "Yuan Shu gained temporary advantage, but it only served to prolong the inevitable."

Shu Fei moved to a nearby digital whiteboard. With a light tap, a depressingly gray timeline materialized on the screen.

"Eventually, Yuan Shu was crushed by Cao Cao. But the most catastrophic outcome was this: when Cao Cao took the two Qiao maidens into the Bronze Sparrow Terrace, he simultaneously seized all of the Qiao clan's advanced knowledge—their metallurgy techniques and astronomical data. They were treated as rare treasures and were locked deep within the Terrace’s vaults."

She turned back, her eyes cold as she recited the unthinkable consequences:

"Knowledge was monopolized. The Sun family’s forces withered, and the Battle of Red Cliffs never took place. Liu Bei was left isolated, Zhuge Liang's grand strategy for a divided realm was rendered moot. Lacking the necessary competition and checks from a chaotic era, the Sima clan's brilliance was left dormant. Technical advancement stalled, and civilization stagnated under a single, unchallenged power. That era of Wei unification lasted for centuries—it was the beginning of the ‘Cao Wei Dark Ages’."

A flicker of pain crossed Lu Rui’s eyes—a visceral memory of that failed history. The rupture of the technological timeline was often caused not by destruction, but by the hoarding and rigid centralization of knowledge.

He adjusted his glasses, reclaiming the pragmatism and coolness of the Bronze Challenger.

"Correct. Elder Qiao Xuan’s knowledge is the key to our current mission, far exceeding the value of any maiden or fortress." Lu Rui's voice was firm. "Last time, we focused on preventing the city’s fall, but we failed to account for his willingness to activate Qimen Dunjia to protect his research. That complex defense system ironically made it easier for Cao Cao to seal everything away."

He looked at Shu Fei, issuing a clear directive: "This time, we must make contact with Qiao Xuan before Sun Ce's army arrives and persuade him to transfer the data to us, rather than using it to resist foreign invaders."

"To infiltrate the heavily guarded Qiao manor and complete the task before Sun Ce's army attacks." Shu Fei was already cycling through potential character builds. "We need identities that can bypass Sun Ce's surveillance yet survive the chaos of an impending siege."

Lu Rui stood up, stretching muscles stiff from long hours in the pod. His eyes sparkled with anticipation for the upcoming challenge.

"I will play a Traveling Merchant from the Central Plains this time. Adept at disguise, skilled in negotiation. Easier to approach the Qiao manor's stewards. And you, Shu Fei?"

Shu Fei smiled—a look of confident, dangerous calculation.

"I will choose a Military Artisan traveling with Sun Ce’s army. A technical role grants me immunity from general soldier protocol. I can enter areas affected by the siege, and perhaps... access Qiao Xuan's own workshop."

Their eyes met. The new mission was locked: The Battle of Wan City. Target: Qiao Xuan’s technological blueprints.
