### The Stage: Virtual Strings

Outside the workshop, General Cai Mao’s five hundred elite soldiers had locked their heavy crossbows into position. The bolts were wrapped in oil-soaked cloth, ready to burn. The General didn’t know the "Hunter" inside was dead; he only knew that this workshop harbored demons capable of threatening the stability of Jingzhou.

"Prepare to loose!" Cai Mao drew his sword, his voice cracking with tension.

At that precise moment, the heavy stone gates of the workshop vanished.

They didn't open. They rippled like disturbed water, then dissolved into transparency.

Cai Mao and his five hundred men froze in terror. They were no longer looking at a cluttered workshop. They were staring into a void, where a colossal citadel floated in the air. Above the ramparts, neon lights flowed like liquid jade and crimson fire, interlocking in geometric patterns that defied Euclidian geometry.

And sitting atop this tower of light was a figure.

It was Zhuge Liang, but he was thirty feet tall. His body was composed of cascading blue data streams, his translucent robes fluttering in a wind that did not exist. Before him floated a guqin (zither), also woven from pure light.

This was the "Holographic Giant." Lu Rui had repurposed the projection capabilities of the "Imprinting Box," amplifying it through a series of polished bronze mirrors positioned around the workshop.

"What... what miracle is this?" Cai Mao’s hand trembled so violently he nearly dropped his sword.

### The Acoustic Weapon

Twang—

The Holographic Giant plucked a string.

It was not ordinary music. Huang Yueying had retrofitted the Thunder Beast’s vocal unit—that massive copper horn—into an Infrasonic Amplifier, wiring it directly to the real guqin Zhuge Liang was playing inside the hidden recesses of the workshop.

The note was amplified a thousand times. Mixed with a sub-bass frequency specifically tuned to induce physiological dread in the human inner ear, the sound wave washed over the encirclement.

"Argh!" The soldiers in the front row dropped their weapons, clutching their heads. Some fell to their knees, retching as their chests tightened uncontrollably.

In the shadows, the real Zhuge Liang sat elegantly behind his instrument. Beside him, Shu Fei (INTJ) held a tablet, adjusting audio parameters with the cool detachment of a sound engineer.

"Lower the frequency by 5 Hertz," she commanded softly. "We want terror, not ruptured eardrums."

Zhuge Liang smiled faintly, his fingers hooking the silk strings. "As you wish. This 'Scientific' instrument... it certainly carries more weight than mere wood."

Twang— Twang— Twang—

As the tempo increased, the Holographic Giant began to Glitch.

The avatar’s serene face fractured, pixelating into jagged shards before reassembling. It emitted a terrifying, digital tearing sound—a "demon's roar" to ancient ears. To the superstitious soldiers of the Han Dynasty, this wasn't a projection error; it was a deity transforming into a wrathful spirit.

"Ghost! It's a ghost!" "Run! It's sucking our souls out!"

Cai Mao’s army collapsed. This wasn't a tactical defeat; it was a cognitive breakdown. Five hundred elite soldiers threw down their crossbows and fled, trampling each other in a desperate bid to escape the neon nightmare.

### The Final Firework

"Extraction window open," Lu Rui announced, watching the surveillance feed. "Yueying, initiate the self-destruct sequence."

Huang Yueying looked at her Thunder Beast one last time. The machine was overloading, red electricity crackling dangerously across its chassis. It was her masterpiece, but she knew the logic: if she didn't destroy it, the "Outsiders" would harvest it.

"Goodbye, big guy." She patted the mech’s cold steel leg, then turned and jumped into the open hatch of the drainage tunnel.

The Iron Triangle, plus Zhuge Liang, slid into the darkness of the sewers.

Three minutes after they cleared the perimeter.

The voltaic battery array inside the Thunder Beast reached critical mass, igniting the stockpile of concentrated black powder.

BOOM—!!!

A small mushroom cloud rose from the backyard of the Huang estate. The explosion generated a localized Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP), not only vaporizing the workshop but frying any hidden electronic surveillance bugs within a two-mile radius.

The "Holographic Citadel" flickered one last time in the heart of the explosion, dissolving into sparks like a grand, final curtain call.

### The Secret in the Chip

One hour later. The Xiang River. A nondescript black-awning boat drifted downstream.

The four passengers were catching their breath. Huang Yueying was heartbrokenly polishing the few tools she had managed to save. Zhuge Liang stood at the bow, watching the distant pillar of fire, lost in thought.

Inside the cabin, Lu Rui inserted the encrypted chip looted from the "Hunter" into his terminal.

"Decrypting..."

Shu Fei leaned in. "Can we read it?"

"This isn't a communication log." Lu Rui’s expression darkened. "It's a Bounty List."

A holographic scroll unrolled in the cramped cabin. The names on the list were the titans of the Three Kingdoms.

Cao Cao: Target Class S (PROTECT / CONTROL)

Liu Bei: Target Class A (ERASE / REPLACE)

Sun Quan: Target Class B (OBSERVE)

Zhuge Liang: Target Class SS (PRIORITY: LIVE CAPTURE / CEREBRAL EXTRACTION)

"Cerebral extraction?" Shu Fei drew a sharp breath.

Lu Rui scrolled to the bottom. Two new entries appeared in flashing red text:

Interferer 89757 (Lu Rui): Threat Level C → UPGRADED TO B.

Interferer 95270 (Shu Fei): Threat Level C → UPGRADED TO B.

"The Heavenly Dao Alliance isn't fixing history," Lu Rui looked up, his voice cold. "They are harvesting it. They want to digitize the minds of these historical geniuses and bring them back to the future as fuel for a Super AI."

That explained the obsession with Zhuge Liang.

At that moment, Zhuge Liang turned from the bow and entered the cabin. He looked at the floating list, his gaze landing squarely on his own name.

He didn't know what "Class SS" meant. But he understood the characters for "Cerebral Extraction."

"It seems," Zhuge Liang waved his fan—now just a charred skeletal frame he had picked up from the rubble—and a smile of extreme danger curled his lips. "That in the eyes of the future, this head of mine is worth quite a fortune."

He looked at Lu Rui and Shu Fei, his eyes narrowing.

"Since we are now, as the saying goes, grasshoppers tied to the same rope... perhaps you two should tell me: Where exactly is the nest of this 'Heavenly Dao Alliance' located?"
