title: "Hacking Game Music: Creating a Full OST with the \"RAYFOS\" Motif and Suno AI"

As an indie game developer, I'm comfortable with code, but creating music has always been a bottleneck. Assets are expensive, and hiring a composer isn't always within budget. Recently, however, I developed a workflow that changed everything.

I call it the **"RAYFOS" Method**. By combining a consistent musical motif with **Suno AI**, I've managed to generate a diverse, high-quality original soundtrack (OST) that feels cohesive and professional.

Here is how I did it.

## The Secret Sauce: RAYFOS

To ensure the game music has a consistent "soul," I defined a core melody based on six specific notes. I call this RAYFOS:

**RAYFOS = Re - lA - mi(Y) - Fa - dO - Sol**

This isn't just a random sequence; it's the recurring theme that ties the entire game world together.

## The Workflow

Here is my step-by-step process for turning this motif into a full track:

1.  **Drafting in Beepbox**:
    I use [Beepbox](https://www.beepbox.co/) for the rough draft. I input the RAYFOS notes, adjusting the pitch (ups and downs) and tempo (fast or slow) to fit the intended vibe. I export this as a simple audio file.

2.  **AI Production with Suno**:
    I feed that simple melody into Suno AI.
    * **The Prompt**: I add descriptive text for the atmosphere and instruments. E.g., *"8-bit, adventure, upbeat"* for a happy track, or *"High energy, rock, anime opening style"* for a passionate track.
    * **The Tuning**: This is key. I adjust the parameters to balance the weight between the "Reference Melody" (my RAYFOS input) and the "Text Prompt."

## The Results

The beauty of this method is versatility. The same core notes create vastly different emotions depending on the AI's processing.

Here are a few tracks from the game using this method. I think they turned out surprisingly well!
