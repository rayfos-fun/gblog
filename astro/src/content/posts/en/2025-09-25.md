The other day, I had a sudden urge to build a simple web game: the classic [Nine Rings](/en/game/nine-rings) puzzle. Confession time: I’ve always struggled with front-end development, especially CSS layout—it feels like a dark art to me. Without AI, I estimate I would spend half a day or more wrestling with forums and tutorials, and still might not end up with a usable product.

But in the current landscape, where AI capabilities are skyrocketing, the concept of Vibe Coding is becoming real—it's something even a nine-year-old (as confirmed by my daughter!) can now do.

# The 5-Prompt Miracle

I decided to put this "Vibe Coding" idea to the test. I opened up Gemini Canvas and started simply with natural language commands, describing the functionality and style I wanted:

1. "Write me a web-based game for the Nine Rings puzzle."

2. "I found a bug. Currently, the behavior is that ..., but it should be ..."

3. "Change the layout from vertical to horizontal."

4. "Reverse the order."

5. "When clicked, move the ring down a bit."

That was basically it. The entire process involved using natural language to communicate my vision. The AI quickly generated the bulk of the functional code, and I only needed to provide specific, high-level feedback for refinement.

The result? In less than five prompts and just a few minutes, I had a fully functional, decently laid-out Nine Linked Rings web game.

This experience was truly mind-blowing. It allowed me—someone with only a passing understanding of front-end structure—to rapidly transform an idea in my head into a running, tangible product. The speed of technological advancement is astonishing, and frankly, I'm excited to see what we can build next.
