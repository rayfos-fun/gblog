**[Spoiler Alert: This post contains spoilers for the late-game mechanics of Baba Is You]**

Finally! I have beaten the Adventure mode of *Baba Is You*! 231 Spores collected! 🌱

The game log says I spent a little over 34 hours, but I know the real time commitment was much longer. Anyone who has played this knows the struggle: the puzzles imprint themselves on your brain. I spent days and nights consumed by them, thinking about logic gates while eating or showering, until—*click*—a lightbulb would turn on in my head. Aha! Solved it.

However, I have a confession. I managed to find 229 spores on my own, but for the very last few, I had to turn to the internet.

### AI vs. Traditional Walkthroughs

At first, I tried asking Gemini for a hint on where to find the remaining spores. The AI gave me some directions, but they were vague and slightly off-target, which only tested my patience. In the end, I had to rely on a good old-fashioned walkthrough community to hunt them down.

It turns out, the missing pieces were in the secret levels within the meta-map. A mechanic I hadn't fully grasped was that you could get those shiny flowers even without technically "clearing" the level in the traditional sense.

### The Philosophy of Uncertainty

Once I saw the solution, I realized I had been painfully close. I had actually considered the correct logic while staring at the meta-map: *Should I try to make `Cursor is Level`? Could I then make Level 3 become `Level is Text + Flag`?*

I had the thought, but I didn't pursue it. I gave up and looked for a guide after a few hours of stagnation. Why?

**Because I wasn't sure if the logic was valid.**

This is the profound realization I took away from this game. In previous levels, I would happily spend hours stuck on a puzzle without seeking help. Why? Because I had 100% certainty that a solution existed.

**When you have conviction and know there is a way forward, your steps are steady. You don't give up easily because you know the destination exists.**

But when you are groping in the dark, unsure if your hypothesis is even mechanically possible, fear and doubt set in. You give up not because you *can't* do it, but because you're terrified you're wasting time on a dead end.

It's a shame I didn't trust my gut on those final puzzles, because the answer was right within reach. It’s a lesson that applies as much to life as it does to puzzles.

### The Journey Continues

My Baba journey isn't over yet. Next stop: the Museum and New Challenge modes. Plus, with the Switch version allowing for custom level design, I think I'll be saying "Baba Is You" for a long time to come.
