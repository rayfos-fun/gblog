🎲 **The nostalgic Lunar New Year game, "Shiba La," is a must-play, but do you truly understand its rules and fairness?**

For many, the Lunar New Year celebration, besides the family feast and red envelopes, isn't complete without some spirited "entertainment" among relatives. Among these games, **Shiba La** (a dice game often likened to "18") holds a particularly cherished place in my childhood memories. Yet, the rules found online always seem to differ slightly from the "house rules" we played with.

Today, I’ll share and analyze our family's classic Shiba La rules. Using probability, I will reveal the **surprising fairness** hidden within this traditional game!

### 🎲 Our Family's "Shiba La" Rules: A Nostalgic Review

First, let's clarify the "Family Edition" Shiba La rules. This version uses **three standard dice**, with the main features and payouts detailed below:

#### 💡 Core Dice Combinations (Rolls of 3 Dice)

| Roll Name | Combination (Example) | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Leopard** (Win/Pay 3x) | 3 identical numbers (e.g., 6-6-6, 1-1-1) | **Highest score** |
| **Big Dice** (Win/Pay 2x) | 4-5-6 | **Second highest score** |
| **Point** | 2 identical numbers, the third is the score (e.g., 2-4-4 is 2 Points) | Points range from 1 to 6 |
| **Small Dice** (Automatic Pay All) | 1-2-3 | **Lowest score** |

#### 💸 Gameplay Mechanics and Payouts

1.  **Player Bets:** All players place their wagers.
2.  **Dealer Rolls (Sets the Benchmark):** The dealer continues rolling until a "valid point" is established.
    * **Dealer Wins All:** If the dealer rolls a **Leopard, 4-5-6 (Big Dice), or 6 Points**, they **WIN** all bets from the players!
    * **Dealer Pays All:** If the dealer rolls **1-2-3 (Small Dice) or 1 Point**, they **PAY** all players 1x their bet!
    * **Benchmark Set (2 to 5 Points):** If the dealer rolls 2, 3, 4, or 5 Points, that score becomes the **benchmark**, and the turn passes to the players.
3.  **Player Rolls (Decides the Outcome):** Each player rolls the dice once against the dealer's benchmark.

| Player's Roll | Comparison to Dealer's Benchmark | Dealer Payout (Player Win) | Player Result |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Leopard** | **Absolute Win** | 3x Bet | **WIN** |
| **4-5-6 (Big Dice)** | **Absolute Win** | 2x Bet | **WIN** |
| **Point > Dealer's Point** | Higher Point | 1x Bet | **WIN** |
| **1-2-3 (Small Dice)** | **Absolute Loss** | 0x | **LOSE** |
| **1 Point** | **Absolute Loss** | 0x | **LOSE** |
| **Point $\leq$ Dealer's Point** | Tie or Loss | 0x | **LOSE** |

### 🔬 Probability Deep Dive: How Fair Is This Game?

After studying probability, I performed an in-depth analysis of these rules and discovered some truly fascinating facts!

#### 1. Probability of a Valid Roll: Exactly 50%!

* **Valid Roll Probability:** The chance of rolling a "valid" combination (Point, Leopard, 456, or 123) is exactly **50%** ($108/216$). This explains why the game's pace is just right—neither too frantic nor bogged down by endless re-rolls.
* **Anecdote:** Even at 50%, probability allows for extreme cases! In 500 total rolls, it's still possible for someone to roll "invalid" combinations (like $1-3-5, 2-3-6$, etc.) **9 times in a row**—that's the beauty of chance!

#### 2. Player's Turn Opportunity: Just Over Half!

Players only get to participate when the dealer establishes a benchmark (2 to 5 points), avoiding the immediate Win/Pay All scenarios.

* The probability of the dealer rolling 2 to 5 points is $120/216 \approx 55.6\%$.
* **Conclusion:** While it might sometimes feel like the dealer is playing a solo game with constant Win/Pay All results, the players actually have better than a 50% chance of getting their turn to roll, which keeps the engagement high!

#### 3. Dealer's Benchmark and Player's Expected Value (EV)

The player's expected value (EV) per \$100 bet changes significantly based on the dealer's benchmark score.

| Dealer's Benchmark | Player's Expected Value (EV) | Analysis and Insight |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Dealer Rolls 2 Points** | **+50%** (Wins $\approx$ \$50) | Gamblers might wish for 2 points to chase the high-payout rolls. However, the probability of those high payouts is too low; it's safer to hope for the 123/1 Point automatic **Pay All** to secure a guaranteed \$100 win. |
| **Dealer Rolls 3 Points** | **+22.2%** (Wins $\approx$ \$22.2) | Despite losing on a tie (3 vs 3), the potential for 2x and 3x payouts ensures the player maintains a positive EV! |
| **Dealer Rolls 4 Points** | **-5.56%** (Loses $\approx$ \$5.56) | The player's EV is close to even. Losing only \$5.56 is remarkably low for a house-banked game, much "kinder" than many casino games. |
| **Dealer Rolls 5 Points** | **-33.3%** (Loses $\approx$ \$33.3) | Even in this riskiest scenario, the player only expects to lose about one-third of their bet, not the entire wager. |

#### 4. The Astonishing Conclusion: Dealer's Edge is Only $0.93\%$!

After a full calculation of all possible outcomes, the **Dealer's overall Expected Value is approximately $0.93\%$** (meaning the dealer averages a profit of only $0.93$ per $100$ wagered by players).

This house edge is significantly lower than most established casino games (which often sit above $2\%$). The mathematical fairness of this specific family version of Shiba La is truly surprising!

### 💰 Betting on Nostalgia, Not Just Probability

Despite the calculations showing the dealer has a positive EV, I still never wanted to be the dealer.

I was young and lacked the "capital," and primarily, I am a clear **risk-averse** individual with strong "loss aversion." While my relatives would bet `$50` or `$100`, I happily placed a mere $5$ wager—my focus was purely on participation.

Though the game's EV for a player is slightly negative, the sheer **joyful atmosphere** during the New Year is priceless! I still smile recalling the scene where my frugal grandfather, after winning big as the dealer, was swarmed by his grandchildren and gleefully "robbed" of his earnings.

Now living overseas, the festive spirit feels subdued. But at least I know that this cherished, traditional game is also mathematically fair, providing a wonderful footnote to those childhood memories.
