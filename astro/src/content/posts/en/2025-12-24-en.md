title: "Tesla FSD Free Trial Review: Why I'm Not Subscribing (and the \"Pure Vision\" Debate)"

Tesla recently rolled out a free trial of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) capability, and like many owners, I jumped at the chance to test it out.

After weeks of testing, I've reached a verdict: **I won't be renewing the subscription.**

While the technology is undeniable, for my daily driving, the standard Autopilot (Traffic-Aware Cruise Control + Autosteer) feels smoother and less stressful. Here is my breakdown of the good, the bad, and the philosophical debate around safety.

## The Frustrations: When the AI Hesitates

Using FSD in real-world traffic revealed several friction points that made the experience tiring:

1.  **Rigid Routing**: If I want to deviate from the navigation (e.g., to take a shortcut or avoid a specific street), FSD fights me. Unless I disengage completely, the car often activates the turn signal abruptly, trying to force me back onto its calculated path.
2.  **Lane Change Anxiety**: In heavy traffic, FSD is overly cautious. It signals for what feels like an eternity but hesitates to merge, leaving me stuck while cars pile up behind me.
3.  **Speed Limitations**: It lacks the nuance of human flow. Because it strictly adheres to speed limits, it can't "keep up with traffic" when the general flow is moving faster, effectively turning the car into a mobile roadblock.

## The Benefits: A Safety Net for Distractions

It wasn't all bad. FSD shines in specific scenarios, particularly for someone like me who struggles with multitasking:

* **The "Co-Pilot" Effect**: I am terrible at multitasking. If a passenger talks to me, I *will* miss my exit. FSD solves this completely by handling the turn signals and exits automatically.
* **Brief Respite**: While you must keep your eyes on the road, FSD is stable enough to allow for "hands-free" moments—like eating a snack or taking a moment for mindfulness. (Note: Using a phone is still a strict no-go).

**The Liability Problem**: The biggest stressor is the "handoff." It feels like the system works great until it doesn't. My fear is that right before a critical failure, the car will simply "give up" and hand control back to me instantly. That anxiety of constantly supervising a "student driver" is often more exhausting than just driving myself.

## The Deep Dive: Pure Vision vs. Redundancy

This trial got me thinking about Tesla's controversial shift to a camera-only approach, often defended by Elon Musk using "First Principles."

The argument goes: *Humans drive with eyes (vision) and a brain (neural net); therefore, cars should only need cameras and AI.*

**I agree that Vision can be the primary system.** However, I disagree that it should be the *only* system.

Look at aviation. Planes are incredibly safe not because they have one perfect system, but because they have layers of **redundancy**.

* **Vision is the pilot.**
* **Radar/LiDAR is the co-pilot and the instruments.**

Currently, it feels like Tesla removed radar to cut costs and force their software team to perfect vision processing. I respect that ambition, and it may indeed accelerate software maturity.

However, I believe that **auxiliary systems will eventually return.** Whether it's due to future hardware cost reductions or regulatory demands for higher safety margins, you cannot sacrifice redundancy on the altar of cost forever.

## Verdict

FSD is a technological marvel, but in its current state, it requires too much supervision to be relaxing. For now, I'll stick to the standard Autopilot—it does exactly what I need without trying to outsmart me.
