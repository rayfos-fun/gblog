I’ve spent the last couple of days trapped in a time black hole known as **2048**.

There’s something incredibly addictive about its simple rules. It pulls you in, one swipe at a time. Fortunately, the hours weren't entirely wasted. After many attempts, luck and strategy finally aligned. I managed to hit the 2048 tile multiple times and even achieved the elusive **4096 tile** once.

My final high score? **52,236**.

I asked an AI to rate this performance, and it classified it as "Expert" level. While I know there are "God-tier" players out there reaching scores I can't even fathom, I’m satisfied. I’ve decided to "retire" from the game right here, at my peak, before I lose any more days to chasing the leaderboard.

Before I quit, here are the strategies that got me there:

## The Strategy: Corner & Snake

The key to high scores isn't just reacting; it's about maintaining **order**.

1.  **The Anchor:** Keep your largest number in one corner (e.g., bottom-right) at all costs. Do not move it unless you have absolutely no other choice.
2.  **The Sequence:** Fill the row (or column) containing your anchor with numbers in descending order.
3.  **The Snake Chain:** Once the bottom row is full, fill the row above it in *reverse order*.
    * Visualize a snake winding from the bottom-right, going left, moving up, and then winding back to the right.
    * 
    * This setup allows you to chain reactions smoothly, feeding smaller numbers into larger ones without disrupting your anchor.

*Pro Tip: Always try to keep your "anchor row" completely full. This prevents a rogue `2` or `4` from spawning in a spot that blocks your merges.*

## From Player to Creator

As a developer with a passion for puzzle games, playing 2048 was more than just a pastime—it was research.

Looking at my current portfolio, most of the games I've released are variations of classic, well-known rules. While recreating classics is great practice, I have a bigger ambition.

I want to create something unique. A game with rules as simple as 2048, but with a mechanic that feels fresh and original. A game that makes players say, "Wow, I haven't seen this before."

Hopefully, one day, I’ll be the one building the next time black hole.
