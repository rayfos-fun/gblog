During World War II, the military analyzed returning combat planes to decide where to reinforce armor. They saw bullet holes riddling the wings and fuselage, so the natural instinct was to reinforce those damaged areas.

However, a statistician named Abraham Wald stopped them. He argued they should reinforce the areas with **no bullet holes**—the engines and the cockpit.

Why? Because the planes hit in the engines never came back. The data was biased because it only came from the survivors. This is the classic example of **Survivorship Bias**.

It’s a simple concept, yet it is one of the most dangerous cognitive distortions in our modern lives.

### The "Highlight Reel" Trap

In the age of social media, survivorship bias is weaponized against our self-esteem. Scroll through Instagram or TikTok, and you are bombarded with exotic vacations, career milestones, and seemingly effortless perfection.

It’s easy to spiral into doubt: *Why is everyone else living such a colorful life while I’m just trying to get through the week?*

The truth is, you are comparing your "behind-the-scenes" footage with everyone else's "highlight reel." People don't post about their boring Tuesdays, their relationship struggles, or their financial anxiety. That data is missing from your feed, just like the planes that didn't return.

Realizing this can be liberating. Personally, as a deep introvert, I took it a step further: **I deleted my social media apps.**

It sounds drastic, but I found I didn't need 500 acquaintances; I needed a few close friends. Without the constant influx of curated perfection, I didn't feel like I was missing out (FOMO). instead, I found peace.

### The Dropout Myth

Another pervasive example is the "College is Useless" narrative.

People love to point to outliers like Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg, saying, "See? They dropped out of Harvard and became billionaires!" It creates a false narrative that formal education is a hurdle to success.

But these are the statistical anomalies. For every billionaire dropout, there are thousands of dropouts struggling to make ends meet. We don't hear their stories. No one writes a viral article titled *"6 Habits of People Who Dropped Out and Struggled."*

The failures are silent; only the survivors hold the microphone.

### Embracing the Mundane

The internet runs on attention, and attention is grabbed by the extraordinary, the shocking, and the extreme. Consequently, everything you consume online is, by definition, an exception to the rule.

The daily grind—groceries, commuting, doing laundry, quiet evenings—doesn't generate clicks. Yet, these "boring" moments make up the vast majority of human existence.

What you don't see—the mundane, the average, the quiet—is actually the truth of the world.

Understanding survivorship bias is the key to mental clarity. Once you realize that what you see online is a distorted reality, you stop feeling the need to compete with ghosts. The boring truth is, you're doing just fine.
