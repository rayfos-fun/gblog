### A Childhood Classic, Flipped

I admit, I haven't seen the original Broadway musical, nor have I read Gregory Maguire's novel. So, watching this film was a genuinely fresh experience, one that thoroughly subverted the cognitive framework built by my childhood viewings of *The Wizard of Oz*.

My memories of the classic story were simple: a Tin Man without a heart, a Lion without courage, a Scarecrow without a brain, and Dorothy—the girl who, let’s be honest, looks suspiciously like Alice from *Wonderland*.

(Side note: I always confused Alice and Dorothy growing up. I later realized that while their faces differ, the Disney Alice and the cartoon Dorothy share a wardrobe that is practically identical. Blue dress, white apron? Check.)

In the classic tale, it's a straightforward adventure of "Good vs. Evil." But *Wicked* flips the script entirely.

### The Origin Story I Didn't Know I Needed

What fascinated me most about *Wicked: For Good* was how it meticulously connected the dots. It didn't just explain the origins of the Tin Man, the Lion, and the Scarecrow; it went further. It explained the origin of the tornado that swept Dorothy away and the true history of those iconic slippers on her feet.

Every element was accounted for, turning the whimsical into the consequential.

### Two Universes or One?

Checking online reviews afterwards, I noticed a common sentiment: many fans view *Wicked* and *The Wizard of Oz* as separate universes.

**I prefer to believe they are the same universe.**

The discrepancies aren't glitches in the matrix; they are simply the result of different storytellers. To Dorothy, the story of the "Wicked Witch" was reality. She was the hero of her own journey. But for Elphaba, every action she took was driven by her own valid reasons, her own struggle, and her own humanity.

History, after all, is written by the victors.

### The Mirror's Edge

Subjective reality is a powerful thing. There is a specific long take in the movie that captured this brilliantly: the camera weaves seamlessly between the world inside a mirror and the world outside it.

It was a fascinating visual metaphor. To the person inside the looking glass, *we* are the ones trapped in the reflection.

It brings home a simple but profound lesson: **Try walking in someone else's shoes (magic slippers optional).**

Empathy—the ability to understand a narrative from the "villain's" perspective—might just be the magic we need to make our own universe a little more harmonious.
