  $30 a bite? Escaping the kids led to a $700 Omakase. It wasn't just expensive
  sushi; it was a lesson in 'Mindfulness' and feeling 'Unworthy'. A luxurious,
  philosophical meal.

For the first time in what feels like a decade, my wife and I had the house to ourselves.

Our kid was off at a three-day, two-night school camping trip. This was it. The golden window. The rare "baby-free" opportunity. We had one mission: do something, *anything*, that we absolutely could not do with a child present.

We settled on an Omakase restaurant with a strict "no children under 13" policy.

Perfect.

### 💸 The $700 Lesson in "Mindfulness"

We sat at the counter, enjoying the ambient lighting, the sophisticated quiet, and most importantly, the complete lack of anyone yelling, "I'm bored!" or "I have to go potty!"

Then the bill came.

Two people, a little bit of sake... **$700 USD.**

This was, without a doubt, the most expensive meal of my life.

A funny thing happens when the price of your food vastly exceeds your weekly grocery budget: you automatically become "mindful."

You're forced to be. When you know a single piece of uni might cost $30, you don't just *eat* it. You *experience* it.

This Omakase was over twenty courses, most of them a single, perfect bite. The food was good. The experience was pleasant.

But I was also, unintentionally, practicing a very expensive form of meditation.
* **Sight:** I carefully observed the gloss of the fish, the precision of the knife work.
* **Smell:** I'd take a moment to inhale the faint scent of vinegar and rice.
* **Taste:** I chewed slowly, meticulously, trying to justify the cost by identifying every flavor profile.

I have never been more "in the moment." This wasn't just dinner; it was a $700 seminar on sensory awareness.

### 🧘🏻 The Verdict: Was It Worth It?

So, would I go back?

Honestly? **Probably not.**

It's not that it wasn't good. It was. But the feeling I was left with is best described as, "This is not my world." It felt excessive. I haven't quite reached that level of financial freedom where I can drop this kind of money on a meal without blinking.

It was a great "one-and-done" achievement to unlock. We paid for the peace and quiet, with a side of expensive fish.

Maybe I'll return when I'm fabulously wealthy and need a "refresher course" on mindfulness.

### 🌌 The $700 Meal vs. The Free-Range Kid

The real irony came when our son returned from camp.

He was bursting with stories, his eyes wide, describing the "sky full of stars" he saw, far away from the city lights.

I felt a pang of jealousy. **"See a sky full of stars"** has been on my personal bucket list for years.

I was just starting to plan a family camping trip when he added the kicker: "But Dad, the toilets were *so* gross. They smelled *so* bad!"

I don't mind roughing it, but that single complaint was a kill shot. My wife—the final boss of our family's travel plans—has zero tolerance for "uncivilized" bathroom situations.

So, it looks like my bucket list item is staying right where it is, unchecked.

Life is funny. I spent $700 to have a philosophical debate with myself about luxury. My daughter, in exchange for three days of filth and smelly toilets, got a priceless view of the cosmos.

And in the end, my own dream of seeing those stars is blocked by the exact same thing: a stinky toilet.
