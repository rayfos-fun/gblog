Just a few days ago, I decided to finally dive into the "AI for Everyone" course on Coursera, taught by the incredible Andrew Ng. After a long day at work, listening to his passionate, well-structured lectures became a daily ritual—a comforting fixture in my digital life.

I never imagined the digital world would collide with my physical world so dramatically.

# When the Virtual Overlaps the Real

This morning, as usual, I drove my daughter to school. While idling at the crosswalk across from the school entrance, my peripheral vision caught a man sitting in a parked car. His profile looked intensely familiar.

I thought, "Wait, is that... the Andrew Ng I watch on my computer every evening?"

My immediate internal reaction was denial: "No way. That’s too big of a coincidence. It must just be someone who looks like him." I shook the absurdity out of my head and went back to talking with my daughter.

But the image lingered. The moment I got back home, the suspicion was too strong to ignore. I pulled up the school’s publicly available information (or the school directory, if applicable).

# The Stunning Coziness of the World

My jaw dropped. It was him. I couldn't believe my eyes.

The instructor whose clear voice and engaging delivery teaches me about AI every day on a screen—his child attends the exact same school as mine!

It makes you realize: We might have crossed paths countless times before—at school events, during morning drop-offs, or maybe even at the local grocery store.

Despite the fact that we inhabit a boundless, globalized digital world, the physical world is far smaller and cozier than we ever imagine, brimming with these strange, beautiful coincidences.

I never would have conceived that a globally renowned AI expert, admired by millions, would intersect with my daily routine in such a local, personal way.

Perhaps this is the true magic of learning. It’s not just the transfer of knowledge; it’s a silent, powerful bridge that connects you—the learner—to people and the wider world in the most unexpected ways.
