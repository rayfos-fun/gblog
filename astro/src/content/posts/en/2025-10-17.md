Time flies when you’re building consistency! Four weeks ago, I set a simple goal for myself: a non-negotiable Flag to spend time on gblog every day and maintain a stable weekly posting schedule.

The initial goal was simple: to fight back against the "time vampires" in my life and channel that energy into creative work that offers long-term value.

Looking back at this first month, I’m thrilled to report: mission accomplished! The compliance rate has been excellent.

I started by posting randomly, but quickly realized that was unsustainable. Through trial, error, and gradual adjustment, I've now established a reliable "Blog Rhythm"—a predictable schedule that keeps me accountable and focused:

| Day of the Week | Content | Focus Goal & Purpose |
| :--- | :---: | ---: |
| Monday | Creative Storytelling | Practice narrative skills by writing fictional or adapted short stories. |
| Tuesday | Life/Productivity Reflection | Introspective posts sharing insights on mindset, time management, or work philosophy. |
| Wednesday | Software Engineering/Tech | Sharing practical experience and theoretical knowledge (e.g., algorithms) from the software world. |
| Thursday | Game Design/Review | A lighter topic, focusing on design, code, or gameplay thoughts on projects (e.g., Four-in-a-Row, Minecraft). |
| Friday | Casual "Off-Topic" Post | Humor, life ramblings, or light-hearted commentary to welcome the weekend. |
| Saturday & Sunday | Rest & Material Gathering | Reading, spending time with family, and charging up for the next week's content. |

Establishing this rhythm has eliminated the anxiety of "What should I write about today?" and successfully broken down the massive task of "blogging" into manageable, daily micro-actions—a key to defeating procrastination.

# Seizing Momentum: My Next Flag is Daily AI Learning

As countless habit books advise: The best time to start your next goal is immediately after you’ve successfully completed the first one.

Now that my blogging routine is established, it's time to direct my focus toward another area that is challenging but crucial for the future.

My next Flag is: Spend time learning about AI every single day.

I know the field of AI is moving at lightning speed, and relying on old experience will quickly lead to obsolescence. Whether it's reading reports on Agentic AI, experimenting with new features in Gemini Canvas, or diving into the underpinnings of LLM logic, my goal isn't to become an expert overnight. It is to maintain sensitivity to trends and consistently integrate AI into my thought processes and workflow.

This new Flag adheres to my "low-barrier-to-entry" principle: I don't need to finish a book or a project; I just need to "spend some time." Even ten minutes of focused learning, maintained consistently, will generate astonishing cumulative results.

From writing to learning, I am ready to embrace this new phase of habit building. What challenge are you taking on next?
