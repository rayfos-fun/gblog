Do you remember the classic electronic game "Lights Out"?

It’s a simple $5 \times 5$ grid of lights. The rule is straightforward: clicking a light toggles it and its four neighbors (on becomes off, off becomes on). The goal? Turn all the lights off.

At first glance, the math is intimidating. With 25 squares, there are $2^{25}$ possible states. That’s over **33 million combinations**. Without a strategy, you could click randomly forever and never solve it.

Revisiting this game recently sparked a realization—not just about the math, but about how much the world of technology has shifted over the last two decades.

## The Trick: It’s All About the First Row

Years ago, I was fascinated by the sheer scale of $2^{25}$. But like many complex problems, the solution lies in finding the pattern that reduces the complexity.

We don't need to check 33 million states. We only need to check the **first row**. This reduces the problem space to $2^5 = 32$ possibilities.

Here is the "Chase the Lights" algorithm:

1.  **Iterate Row 1:** The state of the board is entirely determined by which buttons you press in the first row.
2.  **The Chase:** Once the first row actions are decided, the rest of the moves are forced.
    * If a light is ON in row $N$, you **must** click the button directly below it in row $N+1$.
    * This is the only way to turn off the light in row $N$ without messing up the rows above it (which are already "dark").
3.  **The Check:** You continue this process down to the 5th row. If the bottom row is completely dark, you’ve found the solution. If not, try the next combination for the first row.

Suddenly, an insurmountable maze becomes a simple list of 32 items to check.

## The Shift: From Manual Coding to Vibe Coding

Twenty years ago, discovering this felt like uncovering secret magic. I remember writing a script to "brute force" those 32 combinations.

Watching my code iterate through the possibilities and spit out the solution gave me a rush of dopamine. That ability to write code was a superpower. It distinguished the "tech-savvy" from the rest. I could solve the puzzle because I could speak the machine's language.

Today, the landscape is entirely different.

I don't need to fire up an IDE. I don't need to debug syntax. I can simply engage in what people now call **"Vibe Coding."** I just ask an AI: *"Build me a Lights Out solver,"* or even upload a screenshot of the game board.

Within seconds, the AI provides the answer, the reasoning, and the code if I want it. The barrier to entry has evaporated.

## Where Does the Satisfaction Go?

This progress is undeniably impressive, but it comes with a twinge of nostalgia.

In the past, my sense of worth as a developer was tied to tackling complexity—reducing $2^{25}$ to $2^5$ through logic and code. Now, anyone who knows how to prompt an AI can solve the same problem instantly.

* **Then:** Satisfaction came from the *struggle* and the *craft*.
* **Now:** Satisfaction comes from the *speed* and the *result*.

The "superiority" of being a coder—that feeling that you held the keys to the kingdom—isn't quite as strong as it used to be. But perhaps that's a good thing. Technology has raised the floor, making these "secrets" accessible to everyone.

We no longer need to spend our time brute-forcing the answers. We can just ask for them. And maybe, that frees us up to ask better, more interesting questions.
