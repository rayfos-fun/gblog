This year, Halloween landed on a Friday. Perfectly fine, right? Except it clashed directly with my kid's **Chinese midterm exam**.

As a parent faced with the classic dilemma of "Academic Responsibility vs. Life Experience," I made a choice.

We skipped the test.

### An Unexpected Halloween Twist

In previous years, our Halloween was a familiar routine: endless doorbell ringing, the "trick or treat" chorus, and the obligatory long line at *that one house* (you know, the one that gives out free toys every year, like Maria Mayer's place).

Our focus was always on "getting."

But this year, we flipped the script. We were invited to a friend's party, and our role was completely reversed. Instead of trick-or-treating, my kid was put in charge of *giving out* the candy.

### The Chocolate Fountain & the K-Pop Demons

And this wasn't just dumping candy into a bowl. My friend went all out with a **chocolate fountain and marshmallows**.

My son's job was to man the station. I watched him dip marshmallows into the flowing chocolate and hand them out to the endless parade of monsters, ghouls, and... surprisingly... a *lot* of "Rumi" costumes from that *K-Pop Demon Hunter* show.

### Discovering "The Other Side" of Halloween

At first, he was a little shy, but he quickly got into the rhythm of it. He was "generously" handing out someone else's expensive treats (ha!), and he was loving it.

That's when it hit me. The joy on his face was completely different from the high he got from a full bag of "loot."

This was the joy of *providing*. He didn't have to compete or yell; he just stood there and made other kids happy.

We may have skipped a midterm, but surrounded by the smell of chocolate and a dozen K-Pop demons, we accidentally learned a lesson that's way more important: **it really is more blessed to give than to receive.**

Definitely the best Halloween plot twist we've ever had.
