  100kg of potatoes, 99% water. Reducing it to 98% water requires evaporating...
  half the weight?! The famous 'Potato Paradox' will shatter your intuition.
  Let's dismantle this math magic trick.

**Here is a puzzle:**
**You have 100 kg of potatoes, which are 99% water by weight.**
**You let them dry until they are 98% water.**
**How much do they weigh now?**

Take a second. Make a guess.

If you are like most people (including myself when I first saw this), your gut instinct probably whispers, "Well, it went from 99% to 98%. That's just a 1% difference. So, maybe it weighs 99 kg? Or 98 kg?"

It feels like the answer should be a small reduction.

However, the correct answer is **50 kg**.

Yes, to go from 99% water to 98% water, you must evaporate **half of the entire mass**.

### Why Your Brain Gets Tricked

This is known as **The Potato Paradox**. It tricks us because we focus on the water (the majority component), which changes slightly, rather than the solid matter (the minority component), which changes drastically.

Let's break it down using **Reverse Thinking**:

1.  **Start:** 100 kg of potatoes. 99% water means **1% is solid potato matter**.
    * Solid Mass = $100 \text{kg} \times 1\% = 1 \text{kg}$.
2.  **End:** The water is now 98%. This means the **solid matter is now 2%**.
3.  **The Constant:** The water evaporated, but the **1 kg of solid potato** remained exactly the same.

So the math question is simply: **1 kg is 2% of what total mass?**

$$\text{Total Mass} = \frac{1 \text{kg}}{0.02} = 50 \text{kg}$$

We started with 100 kg and ended with 50 kg. We lost 50 kg of water just to shift that percentage by 1%.

### An Even Crazier Example

If that didn't break your brain, try this one:

You have 100 kg of potato mash at **99.99%** water.
How much water do you need to add to reach **99.999%** water?

The numbers look almost identical. The difference is a tiny 0.009%.
But the answer? **You need to add 900 kg of water.**

**The logic follows the solids:**
* **Start:** Solids are 0.01% of the total.
* **End:** Solids are 0.001% of the total.
* **The Shift:** Going from 0.01% to 0.001% is a **10x dilution**.
* Therefore, the total mass must increase by 10x (from 100 kg to 1000 kg).

### The Takeaway: Inversion

The Potato Paradox teaches us a valuable lesson about data analysis and cognitive bias. When the numbers for the "majority" feature (like water) seem stable, look at the "minority" feature (the solids).

* Water going from 99% to 98% looks like a small step.
* Solids going from 1% to 2% is a **doubling** of concentration.

Next time you see a small percentage change in finance, chemistry, or business metrics, flip the problem around. Look at what remains. You might find that a 1% difference is actually a 100% change in reality.
