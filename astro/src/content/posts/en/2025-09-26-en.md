A while ago, I started hearing my kids humming melodies I didn't recognize. When I finally asked about it, I was surprised—and slightly embarrassed—by the answer.

My daughter looked at me with genuine astonishment: "You haven't heard of it? It's the biggest movie right now—K-Pop Demon Hunter!"

I immediately grabbed my phone and scrolled through my social media feeds, news aggregators, and streaming service recommendations. Silence. My algorithms were still serving me the same familiar old TV shows and classic music I always consumed. My digital world was completely unaware.

I realized my information sources had been walled off by my own interests and clicking habits. This film—a cultural phenomenon among teenagers, particularly in the US—had completely bypassed my digital existence. I was operating on a three-month cultural time lag!

Determined not to be completely disconnected, I raced to subscribe to Netflix just to catch up. Soon enough, my car's playlist was exclusively dominated by songs like "Golden" and other tracks from the soundtrack.

# The Siren Call of the Echo Chamber

This movie wasn't just entertainment; it was a wake-up call. It was a stark reminder that if you don't actively try to expand your view, your information bubble will completely isolate you from the real-world pulse of popular culture.

The echo chamber is comfortable, but it's also a serious blind spot.

In this age of content overload, we need to be more intentional—even deliberate—about seeking out things outside our comfort zones. Don't let the algorithm limit your world to just what it thinks you like.

Have you checked your feed lately? What trend is your algorithm hiding from you?
