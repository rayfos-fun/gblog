Have you heard of the MBTI?

I’m an **ISTJ** (The Logistician). I am, statistically speaking, an average guy. In fact, ISTJs make up about 17% of the male population. We are the most common type—the backbone of society, if you will.

While MBTI is great for casual conversation, I find its true value lies in empathy. Realizing that the majority of the world is wired differently than you fosters tolerance. But more importantly, it serves as a **User Manual for yourself**.

Understanding your "factory settings" allows you to operate at peak performance.

## The Myth of the Comfort Zone

There’s a pervasive belief that we must constantly "step out of our comfort zones" or fix our weaknesses to succeed.

**I disagree.**

Fighting against your factory settings is rarely a recipe for success. It’s a matter of opportunity cost. Every hour spent fixing a weakness is an hour *not* spent sharpening a strength. If you focus too much on patch-working your flaws, you sacrifice the chance to become exceptional at what you are naturally good at.

Instead of leaving your comfort zone, you should aim to **expand it** by doubling down on your strengths.

## Generalists vs. Specialists

Back in school, I excelled at Physics and Math. Yet, my study schedule was dominated by my weakest subjects: Literature and English.

Why? Because the education system (and entrance exams) rewards **Generalists**. They want students with a high "total score," not necessarily those with a spike in one area.

The career world works differently. While companies hire fresh graduates for their potential as generalists, mid-career success depends on being a **Specialist**. As you grow, the depth of your expertise matters far more than the breadth of your mediocrity.

## The AI Factor: Patching the Leaks

This is especially true in the age of AI.

If I have a weakness—say, a lack of specific knowledge or poor writing skills—AI can patch that hole in seconds. As long as your weaknesses aren't "leaking" (causing critical failures), there is no need to waste energy mastering the basics of everything. AI makes being a generalist easy, which paradoxically makes being a specialist more valuable.

Of course, this doesn't mean we should wear blinders. Some of the best innovations come from cross-disciplinary collision.

Nothing is absolute. We must adapt to the times. But in a world where AI can cover your blind spots, focusing on your unique strengths isn't just comfortable—it's strategic.
