  Why I force my ABC kid to learn Chinese. It's not just heritage; it's fear of
  becoming strangers. When 'Bad English' is a parenting superpower: Language as
  the bridge for love.
---
Every Saturday morning, my daughter—a classic "ABC" (American-Born Chinese)—undergoes the ritual familiar to millions of immigrant children: Chinese School.

We even enrolled him in a bilingual international school for first and second grade. I know what you're thinking. Is it worth it?

I have a colleague who is also an ABC. He told me he was forced to learn Chinese for 12 years. The result? He can’t read a menu in Chinatown. Aside from understanding his parents' scolding, he uses zero Chinese in his daily life.

So why do I persist? Why force a language that might eventually fade away?

The reasons are complicated, rooted less in academic ambition and more in a father's fear.

### The Fear of Silence

I moved to the US in my 30s. It’s been over a decade, and while my English is functional—I can handle a meeting—it lacks soul. I stumble over small talk. I miss cultural references. I cannot express nuance, humor, or deep emotion in English the way I can in my mother tongue.

If I don't insist on my child learning Chinese, I foresee a future where we are strangers living under the same roof.

I remember my own childhood. I couldn't speak fluent Taiwanese (my grandmother's primary language). Because of that language barrier, I avoided her. I couldn't connect with my own grandmother. I am terrified that history will repeat itself, only this time, I will be the one left out.

### The "Broken English" Advantage

There is a silver lining to my imperfect English. When my daughter gets excited and starts speaking English at 100 miles per hour, I don't have to pretend not to understand—I genuinely can't keep up.

Because she is still young and not yet in her rebellious teenage phase, she instinctively switches to Chinese to make sure I understand her. Ironically, my linguistic limitations have become her learning environment, keeping her Chinese level surprisingly high.

### Roots and Wings

There are practical reasons, of course. All our relatives are in Taiwan. I want her to know them, not just as faces on a screen, but as people she can talk to. I want to take her back to visit without her feeling like a complete alien.

And yes, there are the standard arguments: studies show bilingualism benefits brain development; China is a massive economy; knowing the language might help her future career.

But history tells us this is a losing battle.

Early immigrants often stopped speaking Chinese to their kids, hoping they would assimilate faster. Today, as Asia rises, more parents want their kids to hold onto the language. Yet, I am realistic. If my daughter stays in America, her children (the 3rd generation) will likely not speak Chinese. The environment just won't be there.

### Language is for Connection

Ultimately, language is a tool for communication. If it's not needed, it fades. I don't believe in forcing it for the sake of vanity.

But right now? It is needed.

I am forcing her to learn Chinese not just so she can read a menu or get a job. I am doing it so that when she is older, and has her heart broken or faces a life crisis, she can tell me about it in a language that I truly understand. And I can comfort her in the only language where I can truly be myself.
