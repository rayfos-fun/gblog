title: "My Child is \"Too Chill\" and My Mindset Was \"Too Old\": A Parent's Confession"

Every child’s personality is unique. Ours just happens to be the "Zen" kid.

He's easy-going, doesn't make a fuss, and sees the bright side of everything. But because he's so unbothered, he's also not much of a go-getter. His life philosophy is basically: "Why stand when you can sit? Why sit when you can lie down?"

As a (formerly) anxious parent, this drove me crazy. I'd quietly steam, thinking, "Why can't you just be a little more ambitious?"

### The Anxious Pusher: What Was I Even Pushing For?

It wasn't until I started diving into books on education and psychology that my mindset began to shift.

I developed a new personal policy: **If I can give him a small nudge, I will. But if he won't budge, or if I can't push him, I'll push myself instead.**

By "pushing myself," I mean working harder to build a safety net for his future, rather than forcing him to become someone he's not.

When I look back, my child already has it harder than I did, and in many ways, he's already more capable. We always say, "Good can be better," but **desire is a bottomless pit.**

* Before he was born, all we wanted was a "healthy baby."
* After he won his first competition, we immediately started thinking about the next level.

This endless treadmill of comparison might move our kids a few *inches* forward, but it risks pushing their hearts *miles* away from us.

### Our "Expired" Mindset is Their Biggest Hurdle

I had a chilling realization: Those few inches of progress were probably more about satisfying my own ego and vanity.

What I truly want, deep down, is for my child to grow happily, to find his own momentum, and **to become the shape *he* wants to be—not the shape *I* want to mold him into.**

This is the hardest part.

> But let's be honest: Most of the time, our "cognition" is from the last generation. It's **outdated software**. And when we force that outdated software onto our kids, we might just be corrupting their system.

I finally understood a key paradox:

**If we want our children to be more successful than us, the best thing we can do is stop forcing our opinions on them.**

After all, if they simply absorb all our views and follow our script, the very best they can ever be... is a copy of us.

We have to let them go. Only then do they have a chance to fly higher than we ever did.
