Every stage of life comes with its own set of lessons. Looking back, my journey has been less of a straight line and more of a winding path towards self-awareness.

### The Gifted but Lazy Student

During my student years, I was fortunate. My family didn't pressure me too much, so I spent most of my days drifting. My grades were a rollercoaster—spiking when I decided to apply myself, and plummeting when I got addicted to video games.

I coasted through elementary and middle school near the top of the class. But once I entered a top-tier high school, reality hit, and I dropped to the bottom of the pack. It wasn't until the top students in my class secured early college admissions and everyone else was distracted by school events that I decided to buckle down.

Surprisingly, I tasted success. I shot up to first place in the class.

At the time, I was obsessed with *Final Fantasy VII*. I had just reached the part where Aerith dies (a tragedy for us gamers). But having tasted the sweet reward of discipline, I packed away my PlayStation to study for the national entrance exams. 

(If you don't know FF7 or entrance exams, don't worry—it just means you're young! For us over 40, those are core memories.)

### Drifting Through the Elite University

I eventually got into National Taiwan University (NTU), the most prestigious university in Taiwan. I immediately fell for the classic lie told by high school teachers: *"Once you get into a good university, you can finally relax."*

And relax I did.

Living in the dorms with no supervision, I completely let go. I stayed up all night skipping classes to play LAN games like *Warcraft (Dota)* and *Counter-Strike*. I slacked off so hard I even failed a History class.

I graduated with mediocre grades, stuck in the middle of the pack. Most of my classmates went on to get their Master's degrees, so I just followed the herd, lacking any real direction of my own.

I remember my advisor giving me a book back then: *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People*. I read it, but it didn't resonate. I was too young and too inexperienced to understand it.

### The Pivot: The High Cost of Clarity

I spent the next few years working in the firmware industry. Since my degree was hardware-focused but my work was software-heavy, I spent my evenings self-studying Operating Systems, Clean Code, and Design Patterns.

Then came the turning point. **My girlfriend at the time (now my wife)** was doing her MBA in the US. She had inside information and urged me to come over. "The software industry here is booming," she said. I took a leap of faith and applied for a second Master's degree. Miraculously, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) accepted me.

At CMU, everything changed.

Because I had work experience, I knew exactly *what* I wanted to learn and *why* it mattered in the real world. But there was another factor: **the cost.**

In Taiwan, tuition was heavily subsidized and relatively cheap. In the US, tuition was astronomical. It instantly drained the savings I had built up over six or seven years of working.

When you are paying for every minute of class with your own hard-earned money, you don't skip class. You don't slack off. The mindset shift was profound.

### Redefining Success: From Efficiency to Peace

I landed a job in the US (the same one I hold today). Initially, I brought my "hustle culture" with me. I worked late. I studied hard skills obsessively. I wanted to be an efficiency machine.

It was only then that I realized why my old professor gave me *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People*. It was a masterpiece on personal management that I had foolishly ignored in my youth.

However, after years in the industry, my focus has shifted again. I no longer obsess over "efficiency." Now, I prioritize **peace of mind**.

Back in college, I dismissed meditation and mindfulness as nonsense. Today, they are my daily bread.

I look around at my colleagues. I am older than many of them, and perhaps my "achievements" on paper aren't as flashy since I started my US journey later in life. But compared to the lost, drifting student I used to be, I am content.

Everyone walks in their own time zone. Every stage of life has its own battles to fight. 

Wherever you are in your journey, keep going.
