In the world of software development, the "Editor War" is eternal. Some advocate for the ancient power of Vim, while others love the modern ecosystem of VS Code.

As a self-proclaimed "old-school" programmer, my weapon of choice has always been **Sublime Text**.

But before we begin, a quick disclaimer: **This is not an IDE flame war, so please don't start one. Respect other people's choices.**

### A Quick Philosophy: There Is No "Best," Only "Best for You"

I firmly believe that everything in life is a subjective **trade-off**. There is no such thing as an objective, absolute "Number One."

Whether a tool is "good" depends on a million different factors:
* **Price:** Is it free, subscription-based, or a one-time purchase?
* **Availability:** Does it support all my platforms?
* **Learning Curve:** Is it intuitive, or will I need weeks to learn it?
* **Muscle Memory:** Does it align with my established habits?
* **Deep Customization:** Can I make it do *exactly* what I want?

Everyone's measuring stick for these factors is shaped differently. If a tool has a passionate following, it definitely has reasons worth defending.

### Why Sublime? Because of "Infinite Possibility"

For me, the key reason for sticking with Sublime Text is simple: **I can easily build my own plugins using Python.**

If there's a feature I don't need, I can make it disappear. If there's a feature I do need, I can build it myself. It gives me infinite possibilities.

I'm not just *using* software; I'm *crafting* my software.

### Show and Tell: My "One-of-a-Kind" Features

Talk is cheap. For me, a perfect editor must integrate into my workflow and become an extension of my brain. Here are a few of my most-used custom functions:

#### 1. The Context-Aware "Quick Open"

I have a hotkey, `Ctrl+O`. Its behavior changes depending on the text under my cursor:

* If my cursor is on the word "task", pressing `Ctrl+O` instantly opens my `D:\MyNotes\task.txt` file.
* If it's on the word "gmail", `Ctrl+O` launches Chrome and opens my Gmail inbox.
* If it's on a project's bug ID, it could be programmed to open the specific Jira ticket.

I don't need to switch windows or hunt for bookmarks. Everything I need is one hotkey away.

#### 2. The "Quick Insert/Replace" Magic Wand

Another hotkey, `Ctrl+I`, is my magic wand for inserting or replacing text:

* Anywhere in a file, if my cursor is on the letter `d`, pressing `Ctrl+I` replaces it with today's date: `2025-11-12`.
* If the cursor is on `T`, it's replaced with the current time: `17:33:25`.

#### 3. The Smart "Boilerplate" Injector

When I open a new, blank file and save it with a `.py` extension (like `test.py`), my custom script immediately detects this. It auto-populates the file with my standard Python "starter code":

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

def main():
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This saves me an immeasurable amount of repetitive typing every single day.

### Conclusion: When Your Tool Becomes Part of You

For me, this isn't just about saving a few seconds.

It's about having a vision for a feature, having a tool that provides the extensibility, and having the ability to customize it yourself. This process not only results in a piece of software that is perfectly tailored to you, but it also satisfies that little spark of developer pride.

"This feature? It exists only for me, on my machine."

That is the romance of an old-school coder.
