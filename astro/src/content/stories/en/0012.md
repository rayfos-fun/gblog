### A-Plot: The Root Cause

Wan City. The Qiao Manor. A secluded study, far from the main hall.

There was no luxury here. Only walls lined with bamboo scrolls and, in the center, a massive, celestial-looking bronze machine that resembled an armillary sphere. Qiao Fu, the steward, had nervously shown Lu Rui in before retreating to guard the door from the outside.

In the center of the room stood an old man with graying hair and a razor-sharp gaze. This was Qiao Xuan.

"You are the merchant who claims to bear a 'Heavenly Secret'?" Qiao Xuan’s voice was hoarse, his eyes dissecting Lu Rui like a hawk.

Lu Rui calmly pushed up his glasses and bowed. "This junior, Lu Yi, pays his respects to Elder Qiao."

"Hmph." Qiao Xuan scoffed, tossing the mulberry paper—the one covered in Lu Rui's numbers—onto the desk. "This 'Celestial Coordinates Correction Set' is indeed ingenious. But..."

He walked to the bronze machine and flicked one of its gears. "Your calculation... is wrong."

He pointed to a specific data set on the paper. "The error in this position is not 'off by two fen,' as you've written. It is 'off by two fen and three li.' You saw the problem, but you did not find the true answer. With such a trifling bit of insight, you dare call it a 'Heavenly Secret'?"

Lu Rui’s (ISTJ) heart rate did not alter by a single beat. He knew. The test had begun. This wasn't a boast from Qiao Xuan; it was a counter-probe from a paranoid "Technological Isolationist."

"The Elder's perception is flawless," Lu Rui replied, unhurried. "This junior knew the data was wrong. If I had written the correct data, I fear you would have seen me as a common thief who had spied on your work, and had me beaten and thrown out immediately."

Qiao Xuan's hand, which had been turning the gear, froze.

Lu Rui continued, "The reason I dared to present this 'flawed' data was because I know, Elder, that your true predicament... stems not from your observations, but from your instrumentation."

Lu Rui looked directly into Qiao Xuan's stunned eyes and delivered his second, and far more lethal, gambit.

"The 'clepsydra'—the water clock—you use for your celestial observations. Its internal bronze gears, due to years of micro-corrosion, have caused the 'rate' and 'flow' of the mechanism to deviate. The longer you observe, the greater the cumulative error becomes."

Lu Rui stated his conclusion calmly. "You don't need to correct your coordinates, Elder. You need to correct your clock."

Clang. The metal calibration rod slipped from Qiao Xuan’s hand and hit the floor.

He stared at Lu Rui, his voice a strained whisper. "Who... who are you?"

This secret—the core flaw in his life's work—was one he had never revealed to a living soul. This merchant not only knew what he was doing, but how he was doing it wrong.

"I am merely a merchant who wishes for 'knowledge' to be passed on," Lu Rui said, bending to retrieve the rod and offering it back. "Elder Qiao, Sun Ce's army surrounds the city. Your 'Mystical Gates' can buy you time, but they cannot win you the war. Rather than let this knowledge be consumed by fire, or locked away by Cao Cao in the Bronze Sparrow Terrace... perhaps it is time to find it a new path."

Qiao Xuan's breathing grew ragged. Lu Rui had passed the test.

### B-Plot: The Unwinnable Test

Sun Ce's command tent. The atmosphere was heavy.

Zhou Yu stood before a massive sand-table model of Wan City. Shu Fei (Su Fei) stood at his side, "protected" by two guards whose hands rested on the hilts of their knives.

"Su Fei," Zhou Yu began, his eyes fixed on the map, "since you could identify the flaws in our army's catapults, you must also see the flaws in Wan City's defenses."

He gestured to the miniature model of the Qiao manor at the center of the sand table. "Qiao Xuan is a master of mechanisms. His defense system is impenetrable to my scouts. From an artisan's perspective, where is this formation's 'Life Gate'—its critical weakness?"

Shu Fei (INTJ) was instantly trapped in a lethal dilemma:

1. If she lied (or feigned ignorance): Zhou Yu would immediately see that her "gear's bite" explanation was a fabrication. She would lose all strategic value, be treated as a spy, and the mission would fail.

2. If she told the truth (and revealed a true, exploitable flaw): She would personally help Sun Ce breach the city too quickly. This would leave Lu Rui without enough time to complete his persuasion and data transfer with Qiao Xuan. Once the city fell, Qiao Xuan and all his technology would fall into the hands of Sun Ce and Zhou Yu.

While this would prevent the "Cao Wei Dark Ages" scenario, it would immediately trigger the "Jiangdong Technological Monopoly" outcome. The seeds of technology would still be hoarded by a single power (just the Sun clan instead of the Cao clan). For Lu Rui and Shu Fei, this was still a mission failure.

She had to provide an answer that was simultaneously correct and tactically useless.

Shu Fei took a deep breath and stepped forward, her fingertip tracing the topography on the sand table.

"Governor, this formation has no 'Life Gate'."

Zhou Yu’s brow furrowed instantly.

"Because," Shu Fei quickly continued, "it is not a formation. It is a 'machine'."

She pointed to a major river that ran alongside Wan City. "The power source for this 'Qimen Dunjia' is not manpower or wind. It is this main river. Qiao Xuan has excavated a complex series of subterranean aqueducts, using massive water wheels to drive the city's defenses."

A flicker of appreciation lit Zhou Yu's eyes. "Continue."

"Therefore," Shu Fei concluded, "to break this 'machine,' a frontal assault is the worst possible option. The only way is to find the main sluice gate for the underground aqueducts and cut off its power source. Once the water wheels stop, the entire defense system will collapse."

Zhou Yu stared at her. "And the sluice gate's location?"

"That is the problem, Governor," Shu Fei looked up, meeting his gaze directly. "This main valve is certainly buried dozens of zhang underground and heavily guarded. With our current tools and timeframe, it is impossible to excavate it before the city falls."

She had delivered a theoretically perfect solution that was, in practice, a tactical dead end.

Zhou Yu watched her for a long, silent moment. Then, he smiled.

"A brilliant analysis, Su Fei." He wasn't disappointed. He was impressed. "Your logic is correct. And while we cannot 'cut it off,' you have reminded me..."

Zhou Yu's gaze shifted back to the sand table, a new, dangerous light in his eyes. "Since it is a 'machine,' and it runs on water..."

"What happens if we introduce fire?"

Shu Fei’s heart went cold.

Zhou Yu, analyzing her analysis, had deduced a new, more terrible tactic she hadn't even considered.

"Pass the order," Zhou Yu commanded. "Gather all the naphtha and sulfur from the surrounding towns. When the main assault begins, I intend to 'add some fuel' to this machine."

Shu Fei lowered her head. She had successfully saved herself, but in doing so, she seemed to have inadvertently accelerated Wan City's destruction. The token Zhou Yu had given her was still in her hand, but it now felt impossibly, searingly hot.
