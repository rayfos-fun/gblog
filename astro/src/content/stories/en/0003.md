# The Fing Butterfly Effect

It sounds like a ridiculous exaggeration, but a single, seemingly insignificant detail really can determine the fate of the world. And that’s exactly what happened.

The brawl at Hulao Pass—Lu Bu against the Three Brothers—it was epic, sure. But no one, absolutely no one, expected that the thing that screwed up the entire timeline wouldn't be some divine martial art or cunning strategy. It was a single, stray arrow shot out of the chaos. It had a barbed tip, and it somehow found the Red Hare’s artery.

And just like that, everything went to hell.

The Red Hare collapsed. Zhang Fei’s spear ran straight through Lu Bu’s heart, basically gutting him on the spot, before Guan Yu swooped in for the coup de grâce. It was cinematic, dramatic, but the chain reaction it triggered was more devastating than any disaster movie.

Dong Zhuo? That bastard practically soiled his pants when he heard Lu Bu was dead. He lost his strongest bodyguard and immediately retreated from Luoyang. He didn't even last six months before his own subordinates took him out.

Of the Eighteen Lords, it was Yuan Shao—that arrogant prick, descended from four generations of top officials, with a background as solid as steel—who swiftly consolidated the entire coalition. He even managed to seize control of the Emperor. Guys like Cao Cao, Liu Bei, and Sun Quan, who were still playing their little Three Kingdoms strategy game, didn't stand a chance. They were instantly crushed by Yuan Shao, the ultimate life winner.

The world stabilized prematurely. The Han Dynasty wasn't technically destroyed, but it was effectively dead—just a puppet on Yuan Shao's strings, alive in appearance but devoid of soul.

# The Locked Drawer

Far away in Nanyang, the Sleeping Dragon—Zhuge Liang—a genius who was supposed to be world-changing, had been waiting for the perfect moment of grand chaos to emerge and assist a worthy, struggling lord. The high-tech blueprints in his head—the repeating crossbows, the wooden ox and flowing horse, inventions capable of revolutionizing the world—were already in the drafting stage. He believed these creations would guide the world back on track and let civilization evolve.

But Lu Bu’s tiny butterfly—that nameless dark arrow—destroyed Zhuge Liang’s life plan. Yuan Shao's dominance ended the period of true chaos too early. There was no desperate, weak lord who needed to beg an eccentric hermit for help.

So, the Sleeping Dragon waited for years. His Liu Bei never came. He quietly took all those design blueprints, all that imaginative black technology, locked them away in a drawer, and lived out his days in lonely obscurity.

Without Zhuge Liang’s divine inventions, humanity's technology tree was fundamentally warped from the start. That intricate knowledge of mechanisms became lost arcana. Future craftsmen groped in the dark, wandering a technological maze. Gunpowder was only good for fireworks; the mysteries of machinery remained unsolved; scientific progress stalled.

When this world finally reached the doorstep of the industrial age, they had already exhausted all their available resources, with no new energy source to take their place.

The once-brilliant flame of civilization, like a candle flickering in endless chaos, was slowly extinguished.

That's fate, the fing fate* of it all. A tiny, seemingly insignificant anomaly can make the long river of history take a turn so sharp you never could have guessed the end.
