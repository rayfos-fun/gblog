# The Reckoning of the War God

In a former life, I—Lu Bu—wielded the Fangtian Huaji and rode the Red Hare, believing myself to be invincible under heaven. Yet, the world is not meant to be conquered by one man alone. No matter how peerless the martial skill, it is impossible to avert a colossal catastrophe single-handedly. At Hulao Pass, though I fought until the sky was dark and the earth was stained, I was overwhelmed. I died disgraced, and the ensuing collapse of civilization burned deep into my soul.

Waking from that nightmare, I knew it was all a virtual simulation. But the vision of that apocalyptic ending was seared into my mind like a brand. I pondered the failure: to truly defy fate and alter the timeline, the valor of a mere fighting man would never suffice. This time, as I re-enter the age of chaos, I must abandon the mantle of the Peerless Flying General and choose a different form—that of a benevolent ruler.

I chose Liu Bei.

Not because of his physical prowess—which was utterly unremarkable—but for the innate virtue and humanism he possessed. Though Liu Bei rose from humble beginnings, he possessed the rare ability to gather men of fierce loyalty and righteousness, like Guan Yu and Zhang Fei. His ambition was never for personal gain, but for the sake of the common people under heaven.

My own life as Lu Bu was dedicated only to carnage and self-interest. If I could inhabit the body of Liu Bei, gathering men of talent and befriending heroes, ruling not by force but by humanity and virtue, perhaps I could forge a true path to save the world.

This time, I will embark on a new journey under a completely new identity. I will no longer be the solitary War God, charging the lines alone, but the virtuous sovereign, the focus of collective hope. I will change the trajectory of history, ensuring that the tragedy of the past never repeats.

Perhaps this, I thought, is the true meaning of “The Greater Xia”—the ultimate hero.
