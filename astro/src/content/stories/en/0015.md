### B-Plot: The Saturation Bluff

Outside the bamboo grove, torches turned the night sky into a flickering, artificial day.

Shu Fei pointed a trembling finger at a seemingly abandoned stone pavilion deep within the grove—directly above the ventilation shaft of Qiao Xuan’s underground study.

"Right there!" Shu Fei shouted, her voice loud enough to penetrate the earth. "That is the main intake valve. Colonel Ding, order your men to pour all the naphtha down that hole! But remember: Fill it up, but do not light it yet!"

Ding Feng signaled. Ten scouts immediately rushed forward, heaving heavy clay jars. The thick, black, viscous liquid glugged down the gaps in the stone floor, vanishing into the dark.

"Why wait?" Ding Feng’s finger was already hovering over his flint striker, his eyes narrowed in suspicion.

"Because we need saturation!" Shu Fei summoned a barrage of fluid dynamics theory to mask her stalling. "If you light it now, the fire will only burn at the surface. You must let the oil vapor mix fully with the subterranean air to form a 'combustible aerosol.' Only that specific mixture will create the explosive force needed to destroy the core!"

She was gambling everything. Betting that this "scientific veneer" would make Ding Feng hesitate for just thirty seconds. Simultaneously, she was screaming a silent signal to the man underground: The oil is coming. Run.

### A-Plot: The One Hundred Percent Choice

Inside the underground study, the air turned toxic. The stinging scent of sulfur poured down the ventilation shaft, followed by black droplets of oil that fell like the tears of a reaper onto the bronze armillary sphere.

Hiss...

The high-tech scanner sizzled dangerously as cold oil hit its superheated casing.

Progress: 98%.

"It’s over!" Qiao Xuan stared at the oil dripping from the ceiling, collapsing to the floor in despair. "They really found it..."

"It’s not over." Lu Rui didn't look up. His eyes were locked on the progress bar. His mind was running a differential equation: the viscosity of the oil versus the flow rate versus the ignition delay.

99%.

"Elder Qiao," Lu Rui spoke with icy calm, his words rapid-fire. "When the scan finishes, I will take you out through the escape tunnel. We have to abandon the machine. It’s too heavy."

100%. [Data Imprint Complete]

Lu Rui snapped the "Imprinting Box" shut, extinguishing the spectral blue light. He grabbed Qiao Xuan’s arm. "Move!"

But Qiao Xuan did not move. The old scholar looked at the oil-slicked armillary sphere, a look of final, absolute resolve in his eyes.

"Young man," Qiao Xuan pulled his arm free. "You have taken the 'soul.' But the 'shell'... must remain here."

He slammed his hand down on a hidden lever beneath the sphere's base.

"If Sun Ce does not see this machine destroyed with his own eyes, he will never stop hunting the Qiao family. My granddaughters... will never know peace."

Rumble—

As the lever slammed home, the underground hydraulic system reversed. Massive gears screamed in protest. The water pressure, originally designed to drive the city's defenses, was now locked back into the boiler. The pressure gauge shattered instantly.

"Go!" Qiao Xuan roared. "This is the self-destruct sequence! I will trigger it!"

Lu Rui looked into the old man’s eyes and saw a will that could not be bent. His rationality took the wheel: The mission comes first.

"Take care." Lu Rui gritted his teeth, turned, and sprinted toward the emergency tunnel behind the bookshelf.

### C-Plot: The Steam Explosion

Outside the bamboo grove.

"Time's up." Ding Feng had lost his patience. "Master Su, to hell with your aerosols. Light it!"

He tossed his torch into the stone pavilion.

Shu Fei instinctively dove backward into a ditch, screaming one word: "Down!"

The moment the torch hit the saturated oil vapor, it didn't just burn. It met the superheated, over-pressurized water system that Qiao Xuan had just detonated from below.

It wasn't a fire. It was a Steam Explosion.

BOOM!!!

An earth-shattering roar tore through the night. The ground in the center of the bamboo grove didn't just crack; it disintegrated. A column of superheated white steam, mixed with fire, mud, and shrapnel, erupted like a volcano, shooting hundreds of feet into the air.

The ten scouts pouring the oil were blown away like ragdolls by the shockwave. Ding Feng, despite his quick reflexes to hit the deck, was rattled to his core.

Shu Fei, having pre-calculated the blast radius, huddled in her depression in the earth. The shockwave passed over her, leaving her ears ringing violently.

Through the chaos, the smoke, and the hissing steam, she saw movement. A gray figure stumbled out of a jagged fissure in the earth near the perimeter, clutching a metal box tightly to his chest.

Lu Rui had made it out.

Behind him, amidst the pillar of fire and white mist, Wan City’s underground defense system collapsed completely. Qiao Xuan, along with his bronze computer that was centuries ahead of its time, was reduced to historical dust.

The explosion had not only destroyed the Qiao family's secrets but had also provided the perfect cover for Lu Rui’s extraction.

Ding Feng staggered to his feet, staring at the smoking crater with wide, terrified eyes.

"This..." he stammered, "This is the power of... 'aerosol'?"

Shu Fei peeked her head out of the dirt, looking at Ding Feng’s shocked face. A bitter, weary smile touched her lips.

No, she thought. That is the power of an ISTJ and an INTJ conspiring together.

Mission accomplished. But now, before Sun Ce's main army arrived to investigate this "miracle," they had to vanish into the night.
