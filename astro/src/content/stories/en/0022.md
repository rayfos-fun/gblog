### The Fall of the Aristocracy

The small, black-awned boat drifted down the Yangtze for two days.

To evade General Cai Mao’s manhunt and the likely satellite sweeps of the Heavenly Dao Alliance, Lu Rui had issued the cruelest order yet: Total Costume Change.

Shu Fei sat huddled in the cabin, wearing a rough hemp sack patchworked with rags. Her face was smeared with soot from the bottom of a wok, and her once-exquisite hair was matted into a bird’s nest. She stared at her reflection in a bucket of river water, her eyes dead inside.

"In the simulation training on the Ark, I never took the elective course: 'How to Roleplay a Perfect Beggar,'" Shu Fei gritted her teeth.

"Not a beggar. A refugee," Lu Rui corrected, busy messing up Huang Yueying’s hair. "Jingzhou is relatively peaceful, but the north is in chaos. Refugees are part of the landscape. It is the safest camouflage."

Zhuge Liang, however, adapted with frightening speed. He had shed his robes for a fisherman’s short tunic, rolled his trousers to his knees, and plastered his legs with river mud. He had even adopted a perfect Jiangxia dialect.

"Auntie Su," Zhuge Liang smiled, handing Shu Fei a chipped ceramic bowl. "To deceive the enemy, you must first deceive yourself. Your gaze is too sharp. It needs to be... empty."

Shu Fei took a deep breath, forcing the murderous intent in her eyes to dull into a vacant hunger. She took the bowl. "Master Kongming, when this is over, I will ask you for lessons in music. I intend to use your skull as a woodblock."

Zhuge Liang laughed heartily. "Then Liang must pray for a long life."

### The "Tuntian" of the Future

Inside the cabin, Lu Rui projected the map from the chip onto the floorboards. The coordinates pointed to a backwater bay near the Red Cliffs (Chibi).

"I don't understand." Huang Yueying held her welding torch (now disguised as a fire poker). "There is nothing at Red Cliffs. Just desolate reed marshes and steep cliffs. Why build a base there?"

"Because of Time," Zhuge Liang pointed to the spot on the map. "I do not know the future, but looking at the terrain, the river narrows here and the current is swift. It is a natural choke point. If North and South go to war, this will be the battlefield."

"Correct," Lu Rui nodded. "Nine years from now, a battle will be fought here that decides the fate of the era—the Battle of Red Cliffs. The life and death of hundreds of thousands of men will release massive energy here."

"Energy?" Zhuge Liang latched onto the word.

"Key historical nodes generate massive 'Quantum Fluctuations,'" Lu Rui explained, trying to find terms the ancients could grasp. "The Alliance built their base here to 'lay the pipes early.' They intend to collect the data and energy released by this future slaughter."

"Treating the lives of hundreds of thousands as... crops?" Zhuge Liang’s gaze turned cold. The handle of his broken fan creaked under his grip. "This Heavenly Dao Alliance... do they view us merely as straw dogs to be sacrificed?"

"In their eyes, this era is just a virtual mine," Shu Fei added. "And you are the most valuable diamond in the pit."

"Good." The anger in Zhuge Liang’s eyes crystallized into icy killing intent. "Then let us make sure this mine collapses on top of them."

### Monsters of the Deep

The boat entered the Red Cliffs waters.

The current here was wrong. The surface was littered with dead fish, floating belly-up. They bore no external wounds, but their internal organs had been liquefied by some unseen force.

"Infrasound," Huang Yueying leaned over the gunwale, sensing the vibrations in the water. "Something down there is emitting high-frequency vibrations. It’s the same principle as my Thunder Beast, but the output is exponentially higher."

Suddenly, Lu Rui’s internal radar screamed a warning.

[WARNING: High-speed underwater objects detected. Count: 3. Distance: 500 meters.]

"Incoming," Lu Rui whispered. "Full alert. Do not use electronic devices; they will detect the signal signature."

Before he finished speaking, the water broke. Splash.

Three black, streamlined shapes leaped from the river like dolphins, crashing back down with heavy thuds. They looked like sharks, but they had no eyes, and their heads pulsed with rhythmic red lights.

Robotic Patrol Sharks.

They circled the small boat, red scanning beams sweeping across the hull.

"Auntie Su, act," Zhuge Liang hissed.

Shu Fei immediately collapsed onto the prow, clutching her broken bowl, letting out a rasping, pitiful groan. "Mercy... spare a bite to eat..."

Zhuge Liang and Lu Rui huddled together, trembling like terrified refugees.

The shark’s scanning beam lingered on them for several agonizing seconds.

Thermal Signature: Normal.

Heart Rate: Normal (Thanks to Lu Rui’s ISTJ biological control).

Weapons: None detected (All concealed in the false bottom of the boat).

[Target Confirmed: Non-threat Refugees. Action: Ignore.]

The sharks' lights turned green. With a flick of their mechanical tails, they dove and vanished into the murky depths.

### Entrance to the Dragon Palace

"That was close." Huang Yueying patted her chest. "Those iron fish swam toward the coordinates."

"We can't sail the boat there," Lu Rui said. "They surely have a sonar defense perimeter."

"Then how do we get in?" Shu Fei asked.

Huang Yueying dragged a large wooden barrel from the hold, a triumphant grin on her face. "Do you remember the 'Water-Repelling Beasts' I was tinkering with at home?"

She revealed three suits made of oil-soaked tung cloth, inflated pig bladders for buoyancy, and long bamboo breathing tubes. Beside them lay a device resembling a large torpedo—a Hand-Cranked Propeller.

"This..." Shu Fei looked at the gear, which smelled faintly of pork fat. "This is operational?"

"Relax. It’s ugly, but the airtight seal is top-tier," Yueying promised. "I’ve used these to scavenge shipwrecks at the bottom of the Xiang River."

Zhuge Liang looked at the equipment and shook his head. "I am not going."

"Is Master Kongming afraid of water?"

"No." Zhuge Liang pointed at their boat. "You three go down to destroy. I will stay above. The Art of War states: 'Engage with the Orthodox, win with the Unorthodox.' You are the surprise attack underwater; I am the orthodox force on the surface. I must provide your 'extraction support.'"

He looked toward the reed marshes, where several speedboats flying "Heavenly Dao Alliance" flags (disguised as river pirates) were barely visible. A faint smile touched his lips.

"Besides... someone needs to distract the watchdogs."

### Divide and Conquer

Night fell.

Lu Rui, Shu Fei, and Huang Yueying donned the bulky "Water-Repelling Beasts." With bamboo tubes in their mouths, they slid silently into the freezing Yangtze.

On the surface, Zhuge Liang rowed the boat alone toward the reed marshes. He pulled out a spare voltaic battery (left by Yueying) and several coils of copper wire.

"I do not fully understand 'Electromagnetism'," Zhuge Liang muttered as he dropped the coils into the water. "But Yueying said: Electricity begets Magnetism, and Magnetism confuses the needle."

He was going to create an Artificial Magnetic Storm to paralyze the communication equipment of the pirate speedboats.

Underwater, the trio used the hand-cranked propeller to fight the current, dragging themselves along the riverbed.

In the turbid gloom, a massive shadow began to take shape.

It was not a shipwreck. It was not a Dragon Palace.

It was a colossal Metal Dome, half-buried in the silt. Thick, pulsating cables extended from its base like the roots of a parasitic tree, drilling deep into the bedrock of the Red Cliffs.

Above the airlock entrance, glowing text visible only to Lu Rui and Shu Fei read:

[HEAVENLY DAO ALLIANCE - HISTORY NODE 03 HARVESTING STATION] [CURRENT OUTPUT: 35%]

Shu Fei sneered over the bone-conduction comms channel. "Found it. The bloodsuckers."

Lu Rui gripped his modified underwater cutter.

"Prepare to breach. Let’s pull the plug."
