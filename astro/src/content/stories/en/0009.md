# The Final Briefing

The immersion pod lid had closed, yet Lu Rui did not rush to log in. He sat at the console, his fingers flying across the virtual keyboard, pulling up the topographical map of Wan City and the architectural schematics of the Qiao family manor.

"A Traveling Merchant—that's a high-risk, low-authority role, Lu Rui," Shu Fei’s voice came from the side. She was reviewing the skill tree for her chosen role: the Military Artisan.

"The low authority is precisely how I evade Sun Ce and Zhou Yu’s highest security perimeter," Lu Rui replied without looking up, his tone unwavering. "My objective is to approach the Qiao manor’s stewards or servants from the outer perimeter, build trust, and pinpoint Qiao Xuan's location and habits. This is the Outer Layer Protocol."

"And my Artisan identity is the Inner Layer Protocol," Shu Fei asserted with cool confidence. "During the siege, the army will demand extensive maintenance and engineering support. I can use the guise of servicing war equipment to avoid combat zones and infiltrate the technical facilities around the Qiao manor. If Qiao Xuan truly holds ancient high-tech secrets, his laboratory won't be in the main hall."

Lu Rui zoomed in on a secluded bamboo grove behind the Qiao manor. "That area is marked as an 'Observatory' ruin. Though dismissed as a derelict stargazing platform, given the close relationship between ancient metallurgy and astronomy, it is likely his Core Data Repository."

"Excellent. Target confirmed: The Observatory," Shu Fei fixed her gaze on the bamboo grove. "Now, let's analyze Qiao Xuan."

# The Technical Isolationist

"Based on the results of the last 'Failed Blooming,' Qiao Xuan is a classic Introverted Scholar," Shu Fei began the psychological analysis. "He’s no general, yet he activated the Qimen Dunjia to defend the city. This proves he dedicates his massive intellect to the preservation and defense of knowledge. His motivation is not loyalty to a lord, but the protection of technology from misuse."

Lu Rui pushed up his glasses, his ISTJ logic instantly hunting for the systemic flaw.

"He is a Technological Isolationist. This means directly telling him, 'We are from the future to save the world,' is a non-starter. It will only heighten his suspicion, viewing us as 'disruptors' who covet the knowledge he safeguards."

"Therefore, we cannot convince him with an 'INTJ-style' grand narrative; we must use a method he can comprehend," Shu Fei summarized.

Lu Rui nodded, bringing up an image of an ancient mechanism—a complex, water-driven calculation device.

"Qiao Xuan’s records show numerous calendrical errors, yet he never openly challenged the official Han Dynasty texts," Lu Rui pointed out the crucial detail. "A man truly proficient in astronomy would not make such basic mistakes. He is deliberately concealing his true capability."

"That is our breakthrough." Shu Fei’s eyes flashed. "We cannot overwhelm him with future knowledge; we must use his own field of study to validate our 'capability' and 'intent.'"

# The Play: A Confidential Calendar

"As the Merchant, I will gain access to the manor’s outer layer under the pretense of selling rare Western Region goods," Lu Rui finalized his plan. "The goods are irrelevant. More importantly, I will hint to the Qiao steward that I possess a set of 'lost, precise calendrical data' that can correct a critical error in the current official calendar."

Shu Fei instantly grasped the tactic. "A calculated offering. This 'precise data' targets the very flaw Qiao Xuan has spent decades concealing. You will use it to prove you have access to the type of knowledge he protects, thereby earning his trust."

"Exactly. The data is ready—enough to pique his curiosity, but not enough to trigger his defensive paranoia." Lu Rui completed his inputs and stood up.

"Good luck, Lu Rui," Shu Fei said.

"And to you, Shu Fei. Don't let Sun Ce or Zhou Yu discover the electromagnetic analyzer hidden in your Military Artisan's toolbox," Lu Rui cautioned.

They exchanged a final glance. The Battle of Wan City was set to be a high-stakes, high-IQ information war hidden beneath the dust of historical conflict.
