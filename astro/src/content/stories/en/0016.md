### Logout: Waking from the Dream

The earth-shattering roar of the steam explosion distorted rapidly, dissolving into a harsh wash of electronic white noise.

Lu Rui felt his soul being forcibly ripped from the shell of the merchant "Lu Yi." A sense of weightlessness, severe vertigo, and the stinging neural feedback of massive data transmission hit him all at once.

"Synchronization severed. Consciousness recall in progress..."

A cold, mechanical female voice echoed. Lu Rui snapped his eyes open. The fire and night sky of Wan City were gone, replaced by the sterile, pale blue bioluminescence of metal bulkheads.

He gasped for air, tearing off his haptic helmet. His fingers trembled slightly—the aftereffect of cerebral overload.

This was "The Ark." The time was the Future, thirty-seven years before **"The Silence"**—the predicted end of the world.

The hatch of the adjacent pod hissed open. Shu Fei stepped out, massaging her temples. She wore a sleek, black tactical bodysuit connected to various biometric monitoring cables.

"My head feels like it's going to split," Shu Fei grimaced. "That final steam explosion caused a synchronization spike. For a second, I actually thought I was being boiled alive."

"But we succeeded." Lu Rui grabbed the hatch frame to steady himself, looking toward the massive holographic display at the front of the command deck.

### Judgment of the Demon

Suspended in the center of the screen was a colossal, shifting geometric entity—"The Laplace Demon." It was the pinnacle of contemporary technology, a super-quantum computer capable of calculating the movement of every particle in the universe to predict the future.

At this moment, the geometric shape was rotating frantically, recalculating the butterfly effect caused by the interference of two "Fulei Envoys" in Wan City, 199 AD.

Streams of data cascaded like a waterfall:

* Observation Point: 199 AD, Wan City.

* Event Alterations: Qiao Xuan Survival (Historical Correction), Core Data Extraction (Variable Introduction), Physical Destruction of Defense System (Trace Erasure).

* Host Status: Merchant Lu Yi (Survived; memory rationalized as a lucid dream), Artisan Su Fei (Survived; classified as a survivor).

Finally, a red numerical value flashed in the center of the screen.

[Current Probability of Apocalypse: 99.814%] [Correction Amplitude: -0.009%]

The room fell silent.

"We risked our lives, blew up a city, and almost got burned to death by Zhou Yu," Shu Fei looked at the microscopic number and let out a cynical laugh. "And the result is raising humanity's survival rate by less than one ten-thousandth of a percent?"

"It is quantum accumulation, Shu Fei." Lu Rui pushed up his glasses—real ones, not a disguise this time. His eyes held the unyielding resilience of an ISTJ. "Before our intervention, that value was a dead, static 100%. Even a 0.001% looseness means 'Absolute Destruction' has become 'Probable Survival.'"

"I know." Shu Fei walked to the console and synthesized a cup of black coffee. "It’s just that this 'Tech Tree' is a nightmare to climb. We got Qiao Xuan’s data, but in the long river of history, it’s just a seed. If we don’t plant it in the right soil, it will still rot."

### The Encrypted Code and the New Coordinates

Lu Rui swiped his fingers across the virtual keyboard, pulling up the data packet they had "imprinted" from Qiao Xuan.

It was a set of incredibly complex ancient algorithms, combining astronomy, hydraulics, and a logic system that surprisingly mirrored modern binary.

"Laplace's analysis is done," Lu Rui reviewed the report. "Qiao Xuan’s data is incomplete. This isn't just a calendar or a mechanism; it’s the prototype for an 'Energy Conversion Protocol.' He was trying to use bronze and water pressure to simulate a higher form of energy generation."

"But he failed, so he hid it," Shu Fei noted.

"Correct. But he left an interface." Lu Rui pointed to a string of garbled code at the end of the data stream. "This encryption logic shares roots with the lost Mohist school of engineering, but it is far more intricate. Laplace suggests that to unlock this code and convert this seed into actual 'Tech Tree Points,' we need a Decoder."

"A decoder?"

"Or rather, a person capable of understanding a design centuries ahead of their time." Lu Rui scrolled the map's timeline, moving the cursor from Jiangdong westward, settling on Jingzhou.

A name floated onto the screen, accompanied by keywords: Wooden Ox and Flowing Horse, Repeating Crossbow, Huang Yueying, The Reclusive Genius.

"Historical records state that Huang Yueying had an unusual appearance but a talent that surpassed even Zhuge Liang," Lu Rui analyzed. "If Zhuge Liang is the software engineer running the country, then Huang Yueying is the Hardware Engineer designing the machinery. Only she has the potential to decipher and perfect Qiao Xuan’s legacy."

Shu Fei took a sip of coffee. The fatigue in her eyes vanished, replaced by the excitement of a hunter spotting new prey.

"So, our next stop is Jingzhou?"

"Affirmative." Lu Rui locked the coordinates. "This time, we aren't just facing the fires of war. We are entering a closed, hermetic world of hermits and mechanics. We are going to find that legendary 'ugly woman' and make her our Chief Engineer."

"Six hours of rest," Lu Rui turned toward the sleeping quarters. "Then, prepare for the second immersion."

"By the way," Shu Fei asked suddenly, "Since the possession is randomized based on compatibility, can I pick a better-looking avatar next time? That artisan, Su Fei... her hands were nothing but calluses."

Lu Rui paused, looking back with a faint smile—a rare moment of humor from the "Bronze Challenger."

"That depends on the Laplace Demon's mood. After all, we are just ghosts drifting in the river of history."
