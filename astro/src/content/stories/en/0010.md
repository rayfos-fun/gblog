# Wan City: The Smoke Screen

Wan City was cloaked in an atmosphere of dread. Though Sun Ce’s army had yet to reach the city walls, spies from Jiangdong and Yuan Shu's garrison troops were already creating a volatile tension both inside and outside the gates. The city doors were sealed, the streets sparse of pedestrians, patrolled only by soldiers in armor.

Lu Rui, operating under the alias "Lu Yi" (魯毅), the Traveling Merchant, looked utterly unremarkable. He wore the common gray cloth robe of the Central Plains, carrying an ordinary bundle supposedly filled with "silk and medicinal herbs." He maintained the smooth, facile smile characteristic of a salesman, but his eyes, hidden behind his glasses, were models of ISTJ analytical calm.

He knew better than to force his way into the Qiao manor.

He had locked onto his secondary target: Qiao Fu (喬福), the Qiao family's Chief Steward. Qiao Fu was the perfect target: a typical miser, yet deeply anxious about his master's safety.

Lu Rui waited a calculated half-hour outside the city's most prominent tavern before Qiao Fu emerged from a side gate, accompanied by two guards.

"Elderly sir, please wait a moment," Lu Rui quickly approached, his voice pitched to be audible but not disruptive, just enough to catch Qiao Fu’s attention.

Qiao Fu frowned in distaste. "Where did this impoverished peddler come from? Get lost! I have no time for you."

"Sir, I am not here to peddle common goods." Lu Rui swiftly pulled a piece of thin mulberry paper from his sleeve. Scribbled on it in minuscule script was a series of seemingly meaningless numbers. "I carry a priceless 'Heavenly Secret'—something only the venerable Elder Qiao can truly comprehend."

Qiao Fu, seeing the merchant's plain attire, was ready to yell. But the exquisite inkwork and the structured series of numbers on the paper gave him pause. He knew his master, Qiao Xuan, was an eccentric who cared nothing for silver or gold, but was obsessive about "celestial matters."

"Nonsense! What is this trickery?" Qiao Fu demanded, his suspicion piqued.

Lu Rui offered a faint smile, lowering his voice as he drew the paper back into his sleeve. "This is a 'Celestial Coordinates Correction Set' from the far Western Regions. It precisely pinpoints a critical error in the official imperial calendar's calculation of a major star's trajectory."

Qiao Fu's face instantly shifted. He wasn't a scholar, but years with Qiao Xuan meant he knew what a "critical error" in the calendar meant to his master—it was enough to invalidate decades of data Qiao Xuan had been feigning allegiance to!

"You lie! How do you know what my master studies?" Qiao Fu's voice shook slightly.

"I don't know what Elder Qiao studies, but I know that should this data become public, the entire Han Dynasty's astronomical system will be thrown into chaos," Lu Rui maintained his precise level of mystique. "It is too sensitive. I dare not sell it to anyone but wish to offer it to the one man who truly understands how to protect such knowledge."

Qiao Fu’s greed and fear were simultaneously ignited: greed for the value of this knowledge, and fear that its mere existence could bring catastrophe upon the Qiao manor.

"You wait here! Do not move!" Qiao Fu commanded, spinning around to rush back into the manor.

Lu Rui stood his ground, adjusting his glasses, meticulously calculating the time Qiao Xuan would need to receive the intelligence and agree to a meeting. He knew that ISTJ pragmatism would always trump spontaneous INTJ theatrics. He had successfully torn a small, undeniable logical fissure in Qiao Xuan's formidable defense mechanism.

# The Artisan's Entry

Meanwhile, outside Wan City.

Sun Ce’s army had arrived at the base of the walls, battle flags crowding the skyline, the air thick with martial intent. Shu Fei, operating as the Military Artisan "Su Fei," navigated the bustling siege camp. She wore rough leather armor and carried a heavy, utilitarian toolbox.

She leveraged her identity, avoiding the main command centers and heading straight for the damaged sections of the wall, already battered by initial artillery fire.

"General, the crossbow units here require emergency repair! The structural stress points on the wall are misaligned!" She reported to a commander, using precise engineering jargon, successfully earning herself a crucial degree of free movement near the battle lines.

Her gaze swept beyond the walls to the bamboo grove marked on her tactical map as "The Observatory." She knew that once the main gates were breached, that would be the rendezvous point for her and Lu Rui.
