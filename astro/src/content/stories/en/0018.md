### The Negotiation Under the Arc

The air in the workshop was thick with the sharp, metallic tang of ozone. The "welding torch" in Huang Yueying’s hand—in reality, a primitive discharger connected to a massive copper-pot Voltaic Pile on her back—flickered once more with dangerous blue light.

"Speak," Huang Yueying’s voice was crisp, carrying a threat that brooked no argument. "My 'Palm Thunder' doesn't have eyes."

Shu Fei, staring at the dancing electric arc, did not retreat. Instead, she took a step forward. Her noble phoenix eyes narrowed slightly, her gaze piercing through the heavy lead powder on her face, sharper than the electricity itself.

"Voltage instability. Flaws in the coil winding," Shu Fei spoke coldly, switching instantly to a technical channel. "You used acetic acid and zinc plates for the electrolyte, but your capacitor storage is pathetic. That thing is fine for scaring peasants, but if you want to kill me, you'll need to step about three feet closer."

Huang Yueying froze. She hadn't expected this "Cousin," draped in cumbersome brocades, to open her mouth and spit out hard-core physics terminology.

"You understand the 'Study of Thunder'?" The murderous intent in Yueying’s eyes faded, replaced by a spark of curiosity.

"I know a little." Shu Fei used her round silk fan to point at the massive metal spider in the center of the room. "And I see your 'Thunder Beast.' The skeleton is exquisite—refined steel and tung-oil soaked timber—but... it doesn't move, does it?"

The words struck Yueying’s sore spot. She bit her lip and lowered the torch.

"It can move," Yueying argued stubbornly. "It's just... its 'heart' is too chaotic. Every time I start it, the gears and connecting rods fight each other. The energy never reaches the extremities."

### The Century Meeting of Hard and Soft

"That is because you have the shell, but not the soul."

Lu Rui, who had been silent until now, stepped forward. Ignoring Yueying’s renewed wariness, he pulled the "Imprinting Box" he had retrieved from Qiao Xuan out of his rough tunic.

"What is that?" Yueying stared at the intricate metal case.

"This is Software." Lu Rui pressed the switch.

Once again, the spectral blue holographic projection filled the smoky air of the workshop. Complex algorithms and logic gates flowed like a river of stars.

"Elder Qiao Xuan spent his life trying to simulate this logic using hydraulics," Lu Rui explained. "But he was limited by the physical viscosity of water. He couldn't achieve instantaneous variable control. But you..."

Lu Rui looked at the metal spider and the copper wires strewn across the floor. "You possess the medium Qiao Xuan could only dream of—Electricity. But you lack the logic to direct the flow."

Huang Yueying stared obsessively at the data stream floating in the air. As a genius engineer, she instantly recognized the value of the algorithms. It was the missing brain for her violent, uncontrollable "Thunder Beast."

"Heavens..." Yueying murmured, reaching out to touch the light. "Perfect circuits... If I had this, my servo-motors could..."

She snapped her head around to look at Lu Rui and Shu Fei, the blue light in her eyes shining brighter than any arc. "Who are you? Grandmasters of the lost Mohist school? Or immortals fallen from the sky?"

"We are Time Correctors," Shu Fei gave an ambiguous but sufficiently impressive answer. "We are here to ensure this technology is not lost to history."

### The Shadow of Kongming

The misunderstanding resolved, the trio rapidly shifted into "R&D Mode."

It was a surreal scene that transcended millennia: a dirty carpenter, a high-born noblewoman, and a cyberpunk mechanic, sitting in a Han Dynasty workshop discussing cybernetics and energy conversion.

"So, if we write this algorithm into this 'lodestone array,' the Thunder Beast will move?" Yueying held a magnet, excited as a child.

"Theoretically," Lu Rui was already inspecting the mech's joint structure. "But we have another problem. This machine's power consumption is massive. Your acetic acid battery pack won't last ten minutes."

"That brings us to him," Yueying suddenly sighed, her expression complicating. She walked to the corner and kicked a crate filled with bamboo scrolls.

"Zhuge Kongming?" Shu Fei instantly caught the keyword.

"That bookworm," Yueying pouted. "He doesn't know how to build machines, but he has researched 'borrowing power.' He sent over a theory on 'Windborne Energy Accumulation'—claiming we can use natural wind to generate power. I always thought he was just writing poetry, so I ignored it."

Lu Rui and Shu Fei exchanged a glance.

Zhuge Liang + Huang Yueying = Wind Turbines + Electric Mecha?

This was the true face of the Shu-Han Tech Tree!

"Bring me his scrolls," Lu Rui commanded, taking charge. "Shu Fei, you integrate the algorithm. Yueying, you modify the battery array. I'll see if Kongming's 'Wind Science' can be grid-integrated."

### The Uninvited Guest

Just as the "Iron Triangle" was preparing to pull an all-nighter, a heavy, rhythmic pounding resonated from the stone door.

It wasn't a normal knock. It had cadence. It had syntax.

Clack. Clack-clack. Clack—

Huang Yueying’s face fell. "Disaster. It's the bookworm. Why is he here in the middle of the night?"

"Zhuge Liang?" Shu Fei raised an eyebrow. "He can solve the 'Tian-Yuan Lock' at the entrance?"

"He solved it three years ago. He just pretends he can't to save my face, standing outside reciting poems," Yueying rubbed her forehead in exasperation. "But his knocking rhythm is wrong today... Is this a musical code?"

No, it wasn't Morse Code, and it wasn't music. To Lu Rui’s ears, the rhythm was alarmingly familiar.

It wasn't a request for entry. It was an Alarm.

From outside the heavy stone, a young man's voice—gentle, refined, yet laced with rare urgency—penetrated the room.

"Yueying! Extinguish the lights! General Cai Mao's army is here... and they have brought 'Yi Ren' (Outsiders) into the estate!"

"Outsiders"?

Alarm bells rang violently in Lu Rui’s mind. In this "Three Kingdoms" simulation, who else could be called an "Outsider" or "Anomaly" besides the Fulei Envoys?

Could it be... that in this game, there were truly other players?
