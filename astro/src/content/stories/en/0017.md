### Login: Sawdust and Silk
The moment consciousness reconnected, there was no metallic tang of blood, nor the stench of a burning city. Instead, Lu Rui’s senses were flooded with the rich, dry aroma of sanded wood.

He opened his eyes to find himself sitting on a low stool, a rough sheet of sandpaper in his hand, vigorously polishing a massive log. His hands were covered in thick calluses, and dark grime was embedded deep under his fingernails.

"Ah Mu! Why are you spacing out?" A middle-aged supervisor slapped the back of his head. "Master Huang’s 'Wooden Kite' is scheduled for a test flight tomorrow. If this main wing spar isn't smooth as glass, I’ll skin you alive!"

Lu Rui immediately assimilated the role.

* Host Identity: Ah Mu. A low-level carpenter's apprentice in the residence of the renowned Jingzhou scholar, Huang Chengyan.
* Clearance Level: Low. Access limited to basic materials; core areas restricted.
* Tactical Advantage: Invisibility. No one pays attention to a carpenter, allowing him to freely observe this estate of mechanical miracles.

Lu Rui lowered his head in submission, "Yes, sir." Yet, his hands resumed their work with machine-like precision. In a brief pause, he instinctively reached up to push his glasses—a phantom gesture, as his current face was bare.

He looked up, scanning his surroundings, and a shockwave went through his mind.

This was no ordinary Han Dynasty estate. In the courtyard, wooden magpies hopped between tree branches. Their movements were stiff, staccato, but they were undeniably moving. On the distant covered walkway, the tea server wasn't a maid, but a crude prototype of a "Wooden Ox"—a clockwork automaton gliding slowly along a recessed track in the floor.

This was Jingzhou. Huang Chengyan’s residence. A Steampunk laboratory hidden amidst the chaos of the Three Kingdoms.

### Shu Fei’s "Noble" Misery
Meanwhile, in a boudoir on the other side of the estate.

"This is... a torture device."

Shu Fei stared at herself in the bronze mirror and let out a sigh of pure despair. She had gotten her wish for a "better-looking" role—she was Cai Yan (a distant cousin of the clan, not the famous poetess), a noble lady visiting the Huang family.

She was draped in layers of heavy Shu brocade, her head weighed down by golden hairpins, her face plastered with thick lead powder. Two young maids flanked her, chirping excitedly as they held up an embroidery hoop, asking for her advice on stitching mandarin ducks.

* Host Identity: Lady Cai. A noblewoman and cousin to Huang Yueying.
* Clearance Level: High. Free access to the inner courtyards.
* Tactical Disadvantage: Negative Mobility. The dress weighed a ton, making running impossible. Furthermore, the slightest breach of etiquette would draw unwanted suspicion.

"Miss, why aren't you speaking?" one maid asked.

Shu Fei took a deep breath, suppressing the urge to turn the embroidery needle into a throwing dart. She adopted a haughty, aristocratic tone. "I am contemplating... the structural mechanics of the duck's anatomy."

The maids looked at each other, confused but impressed.

### The Garden Rendezvous
Afternoon. The Huang Estate Garden.

Lu Rui (Ah Mu), shouldering the polished timber, crossed paths with Shu Fei, who was "admiring the flowers" in a pavilion (while actually scanning for mechanism inputs).

Their eyes met.

Lu Rui looked at the elaborately dressed Shu Fei, who looked ready to kill someone. The corner of his mouth twitched. Shu Fei looked at the dirt-streaked Lu Rui, hugging a log. A flicker of schadenfreude lit her eyes.

Ensuring no one was within earshot, Shu Fei whispered, "The Laplace Demon has a sense of humor. My hemline feels like I'm wearing a weighted vest."

"At least you have clearance for the inner sanctum," Lu Rui replied under his breath, pretending to inspect the wooden railing of the pavilion. "I just ran a visual scan. The layout of this estate defies standard architecture. It’s a massive 'Eight Trigrams Array' (Bagua)."

"I noticed," Shu Fei said, hiding her mouth behind a round fan, her eyes sharp. "The paths are fluid. Those wooden birds, the tracks on the ground—they are sensors. Huang Yueying has hidden herself in the eye of the formation."

"Rumors say Huang Yueying is ugly—yellow hair, dark skin—so she hides from the world," Lu Rui recalled the history.

"That describes ancient aesthetics," Shu Fei scoffed. "In my database, such 'anomalies' usually indicate genetic mutation or... long-term exposure to radiation."

Lu Rui paused. "You mean what she's researching... is radioactive?"

"Qiao Xuan used water to simulate energy. Huang Yueying might be playing with something far more dangerous," Shu Fei snapped her fan shut. "Tonight at midnight. I'll acquire the map of the inner court. You handle the patrolling wooden men."

### The Midnight Cipher
Midnight. The moon was obscured by high clouds.

Lu Rui used his carpenter's tools to dismantle the locking mechanism of the rear courtyard gate with ease. To him, this was simpler than writing code.

The two agents crept toward the legendary forbidden zone—"The Workshop Pavilion."

It was an isolated, three-story wooden pagoda. There were no stairs, only gears and suspension baskets floating in the hollow center. Blocking the entrance was a massive stone door.

There was no keyhole. Only a grid of nine sliding wooden blocks—a "Nine Palace" sliding puzzle.

"This is the security system?" Shu Fei raised an eyebrow.

"No, this is an IQ Filter," Lu Rui stepped forward, his fingers tracing the blocks. "Only those who can solve the mathematical riddle earn the right to see her. Huang Yueying doesn't waste time on mediocrity."

Lu Rui’s mind raced. This wasn't a static puzzle. The symbols on the blocks were the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches, corresponding to the current time and astronomical alignment.

"It’s a dynamic password," Lu Rui noted. "We must move the 'Jia-Zi' block to the 'Tian-Yuan' position. We have a three-second window based on the current star positions."

"Three seconds?" Shu Fei frowned. "Mechanical transmission has lag. One person can't do it alone."

"That’s why there are two of us."

Lu Rui looked at Shu Fei. "I'll handle the calculation and the left rail. You take the right. On my mark."

"Three. Two. One. Push!"

Their fingers danced across the stone door. The wooden blocks clacked rhythmically, sounding like the typing of a mechanical keyboard.

"Last step. Align!"

As the final block slid into its slot, a deep, heavy rumble resonated from within the stone.

Boom—

The stone door slid open to the sides.

However, they were not greeted by stacks of blueprints. They were hit by a blast of heat and the blinding flash of electric arcs.

In the center of the workshop, a massive, grotesque metal spider was operational, its abdomen glowing with a spectral blue light—identical to the data Lu Rui had imprinted from Qiao Xuan.

Perched on top of the metal spider sat a young woman. She wore protective goggles, her hair was a mass of golden waves (singed black at the tips by soot), and her skin was a healthy, sun-kissed wheat color. In her hand, she held a bizarrely shaped "welding torch," and she was looking down at the two intruders with surprise.

This wasn't an "ugly woman." This was a Cyberpunk Technician born in the wrong millennium.

The girl lifted her goggles, revealing eyes as blue as a deep lake. She looked at the noblewoman in brocade and the ragged carpenter, a playful, dangerous smile curling her lips.

"To solve my 'Tian-Yuan Lock'..." She raised the welding torch, aiming the nozzle at them. Blue electric arcs danced at the tip.

"Are you spies sent by that suitor, Zhuge Kongming? Or..."

Her smile vanished.

"...Are you thieves here to steal the blueprints for my 'Thunder Beast'?"
